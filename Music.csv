I drove there, tried it.
When I played scales two notes seemed weird.
I was very paniced tho, because I have social anxiety and for that reason, I didn't notice it anymore when I checked a second time.
Well, turns out, 2 out of the 52 plates are just tuned wrong.
It can happen, even in brand new instruments. Still sucks.

I feel so stupid, that was the first time I ever stent that much money on my own, I am only 19.
The instument cost 1800‚Ç¨, new would have cost 2500‚Ç¨ and getting 2 replacement plates costs 160‚Ç¨.

Music,um0zvy,Chizumi205,1,Can't find a music about a baby that never grows old,"Hi people! 

Recently I've often found myself thinking about a song that fascinated me years ago, and for some reasons I can't seem to find It. It's written as a fairy tale/legend song, and the story should be this from what I can remember: a woman can't get pregnant, so she go spend a night in the woods with the fairies and the fae queen. The queen hears her prayers and gives her a child, but warns her about the consequences. When the woman goes home, she has her baby, and for the first period everything is fine and wonderful. After a while, though, the lady notices something eerie: the child doesn't grow old. The woman tries to go back in the woods to pray the fae queen to lift her from this burden, but as the song says the fairies can't be found and the stones are silent, loosely paraphrased. The woman, to her credit, doesn't abandon the child and cares for him for no less than 50 years, when she finally dies of old age. Only at that point, the queen fae returns to pick the forever baby and leaves again. The lesson of the story should be ""be cautious about what you wish for, and about making deals with the fairies"".  


It was a good, interesting song, and It sounded sort of like ""Song of Witches"".

Can someone please help me remember? xD",0,1652129487

Travis Scott is performing at the 2022 Billboard Music Awards. The awards show will broadcast live on NBC this Sunday, May 15 at 8 p.m. Eastern. The BBMAs performance will mark Scott‚Äôs first major public appearance since the 2021 Astroworld Festival that left 10 people dead.

Astroworld took place in November 2021, and Scott has slowly been returning to the public eye. In late March, he performed a brief set at a private pre-Oscars house party in Bel Air, California. The following month, the rapper also appeared at a Coachella afterparty, where he played five of his own songs during a brief DJ set in a La Quinta Venue. He was then featured on Southside and Future‚Äôs single ‚ÄúHold That Heat,‚Äù and was announced as a performer at three South American music festivals.

In addition to Travis Scott, the 2022 Billboard Music Awards will feature performances from Burna Boy, Latto, Megan Thee Stallion, Rauw Alejandro, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Mary J. Blige, Florence and the Machine, Maxwell, Morgan Wallen, and Silk Sonic. The show is hosted by Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs.

Morgan Wallen was barred from attending or performing at the 2021 Billboard Music Awards after video emerged of the country superstar using a racist and anti-Black slur. He still won three awards at the 2021 BBMAs based on Billboard chart performance data. MRC Live &amp; Alternative, the producer of the BBMAs, explained its decision to include Wallen in this year‚Äôs show in a statement to Billboard:

We oppose discrimination, harassment, or racism of any kind. We believe in treating everyone with dignity and respect. After a thorough review and robust discussions internally and with the artist‚Äôs team, in which we found a demonstrated and ongoing commitment to meaningful work and outreach, we extended an invitation to participate in this year‚Äôs show.",0,1652125917

I looked into 30 seconds of mars, five finger death punch, staind, seether, nothing more, and asking alexandra. Unless, I missed a song... I can't figure out where that verse is from...   


Does anyone else hear something similar? I appreciate the help!

I think a lot of replies will talk about how apples-to-oranges this comparison is, but if you think about it, there‚Äôs a lot of similarities between nu metal  and soundcloud rap. They both seem to attract similar audiences, and fill similar niches within society. The Nu Metal bands and soundcloud rappers both had colorful images and devoted fanbases despite maybe not being the most embraced music on the radio. Both seemed to attract young preteen boys from the suburbs, and both genres don‚Äôt get a lot of respect from critics.

About a month ago, I woke up at 6am, set a 24h timer, and started writing an album. I'm still not 100% sure why I did, but it's happened, and the album has just come out. 

The music is kinda ""bedroom indie"", so like Rex or Lovejoy, just with less quality music and more sleep deprivation. 

I'd love if anyone checked it out, I've got a link to the Spotify and YouTube page, but it's out on all streaming sites if you just search up ""crocodile boy"":

Music,uljndj,IXBlackHeartXI36,1,Genres of music that never use low notes?,"I know this is an odd question. I'm asking this, because I'm having a stupid hardware issue. Not long ago I got myself a new CD player. Upon listening to one of my old CDs in it though, I found that it sounds dramatically better than it does on my computer. And yes, I'm using the exact same headphones for both (I only have one pair).

Screwing around, I determined that the sound card in my computer can't play low notes. I figured this out, after switching over to the nvidia card, and found that songs sounded completely different! And by different, as in all the notes I was hearing before were gone, and now all I had were low notes. For comparison, my CD player can play both at the same time without issue. 

I've thought about getting one of those external sound cards, but I don't know what to pick, and due to finances I won't be able to get one any time soon. I'm thinking I need to just accept my situation and only listen to music where it doesn't matter that I can't hear low notes. As for why I'm not using the nvidia, as said it can only play low notes, but the sound card can play both high and medium notes, resulting in noticeably more notes, which is why I'm opting for this. Besides, the nvidia card just makes everything sound stupid, since it outright won't play most notes. 

I've had people tell me my issue with finding music may be my sound card, and now I'm convinced it is. I've actually been looking up iconic metal songs, only to find they sound flat! And keep in mind, I am a metal fan here. The first thing that made me thing there was an audio issue with my computer is when I found a video of some guy playing various iconic metal riffs. He altered the tuning to be a bit higher on all the songs, and it gave all of them far more texture. In fact, the actual songs sound utterly flat in comparison. 

So clearly, I need to give up trying to get into metal again, and just choose something my computer can actually play decently enough. I have no clue what that would be though. Clearly metal and most rock songs aren't going to do. The only thing I can of think of where low notes are rare is stinking pop music, which I am NOT going to listen to at all. I was into k-shit for a decade, but I gave up on it in 2019 because I was sick of all the horror stories coming from the industry. Now though I figured that one of the reasons I listened to k-shit was because it was the only thing I knew of that sounded decent on my computer! I did try jpop, but honestly it outright sucks, and besides, they're apparently starting to adopt k-shit industry practices due to their success. Fucking great. I've even tried to listen to modern American pop, which I haven't done since the late 2000s. Obviously, it doesn't appeal to me, I hate how stinking dirty everything is, and besides all the r&amp;b stuff just sounds like a really bad attempt at a power ballad. 

So, what could I listen to that would actually sound decent on my shitty audio equipment? If there's too many things to list, then how about instead listing things to avoid? Clearly metal and rock, or anything 'heavy' is off the list. Is there anything besides that though? Hip hop maybe I guess, but that's the only thing I could think of.",0,1652072358

We are all fantastic musicians, professionally trained, put on a great show, and bring in thousands for the bars we play at. Of course every show is a little different, but I often leave with less pay than what I deem to be fair. Am I wrong for expecting more than $100 and proper compensation? We always split profits equally.

I consider myself to be a great negotiator, but the leader of the band accepts these gigs with his emotions rather than properly negotiating for fair compensation. So what are some negotiating techniques and aspects that should be considered when setting up a gig?",0,1652063240

My name is Dakotah, I am new to this website, and I have a big dream on creating a book of the top 1000 songs of all time book...

It's only for personal reasons and don't plan on making money and publishing it, but to do a social community project on...

The book and list is already ranked with 1000 songs I felt were worthy to be on the large list, however I got the fun time of having small (3-4 sentence) summaries on each song on why they love it or why it belongs in this book.

However 1000 songs to do alone is quite alot.. For anyone who is interested in music, writing and helping as a community whole, I decided to turn towards this platform for help..

For those who are interested and want to help out, please dm me and I can help explain more of the process, thank you and hope you all have a wonderful rest of your evening and Happy Mother's Day...",0,1652062428

And no this is not coming some middle aged grouch who hates the youth (I‚Äôm 21). The quality of music being put out today is genuinely horrendous and i feel that is not an exaggeration. Every single artist (with thr exception of a rare few) aims to sound exactly the same as each other in every way. Instrumentals and beats are very often indistinguishable from one artist to the next and it only gets worse when you look at the subject matter for lyrics. Almost every single song put out today revolves around sex,drugs, partying or anything related to flirting with women and it almost always sang/rapped using identical words or corny metaphors. I blame social media largely for this cultural change as people seem to be more focused on personality rather than talent which is just a tragic shame. This is best seen when we look at just how many talentless tik tok/ social media stars get gifted songs by big labels (that they had no involvement in writing themselves) just because they have a large following. Pre social media, bands and artist could only blow up if they were ACTUALLY TALENTED but that seems like it is a lost fantasy now.",0,1652046255

Honestly, I would love to be in a famous/successful band, or be a very successful/well known producer or something like that, and make a lot of money (I‚Äôm not going to deny that I value money at least a bit). I want do something I enjoy, but also get paid nicely. I‚Äôm aware none of those professions I listed are very‚Ä¶ likely (we all have those dreams when we‚Äôre young, but how many of them come true?). Especially since the music style I like is more like, 60‚Äôs rock sort of stuff, and right now single person pop is more popular, and I‚Äôm just not as interested in that style of music. I still have some hope that I can do what I enjoy, and be able to be well known in the music industry, but honestly, I know I‚Äôm being very unrealistic. Anyway, getting a bit off topic here.

BUT that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking about this! Now, I would like to be a music teacher/band director or something, but that doesn‚Äôt pay that well (my standards are high, I know). I could own a music store or something, but would that even be that profitable in 15 years? I‚Äôm not some hands on person, so I doubt I could do repairs, which would probably be necessary to own a music store. But that‚Äôs one of my favorite possibilities, owning a music store. I just need some hope because the only thing that seems appealing to me right now is being a musician, and I‚Äôm freaking out about it every other day. I have some ideas other than music, but those all seem very unenjoyable to me at this point in my life‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just at a loss, because I don‚Äôt want to have to live with my parents when I turn 18, or not be able to do anything after I (hopefully) go to college. 

So, what I‚Äôm trying to ask, do you guys have any ideas (I play clarinet, can sing a little, and I want to learn piano and guitar)? If you‚Äôre a musician, how are you doing with financial stuff, and what do you do specifically? I‚Äôm really worried about it right now, as it‚Äôs not like schools suggest any careers in music when career plans are being discussed, so any somewhat positive response would probably help (but writing about it has made me feel much better).",0,1652045090

Mine are:
1) Big Man - Antibalas - this song describes the toil and insurmountable odds facing the working man

2) Thieves In The Night - Black Star - Everytime I listen I feel I gain a little more insight into the incredible lyricism.

3) System Blower - Death Grips - In my mind he‚Äôs using blowing a stereo system as an analogy for overthrowing the powers that be. Best listened to loud.

As I write this it seems wrong not to have Rage Against The Machine, Fela Kuti, Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and so many more named. Who do you all think of. It‚Äôs tough keeping it to 3!",0,1652044400

is it bad if i don't start straight away with spotify? soundcloud is easier right now, and about youtube, i already have a music video, main reason why i wanted to upload it on there.

I used to have it on my HDD nearly 14 years ago, loved it a lot and listened on repeat quite often when biking. Problem is, I lost the file due to corrupted HDD and now trying to find it, but had no luck since. 

I only remember the lyrics and a bit of tune to it, but since I can't really describe the tune on here, I'd like to post the lyrics (or ones that I assume are the ones in the song)   


Trance Genre Song 

In the chorus part of this Trance Song, a womans voice sings "" ***clooooooser....  need you to be cloooser... cloooooser.. but i can't be without youuuuuu...*** "" and then the beat starts. 

These are the only lyrics within the entire song; Beat Style of the Kicks AND the Rhythm of the melody is rather similar to this industrial sounding song  ' **As the Rush Comes '** by Motorcycle **'** **(**[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tO9gT0zwWl0**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tO9gT0zwWl0)**)** ', however it's a bit more faster paced than melody.  


I'm so desperate for this song, that as I mentioned in the title as well, i'd be wanting and willing to pay $20 via paypal to whoever locates this song. Truly it means this much to me.

That was the first time I heard a song from The Red Hot Chili Peppers (I come from a small rural town with 3 country stations and 1 Oldies station to choose from).

It felt like each soundtrack was a peak into a broader world I was only just discovering.

The Matrix soundtrack exposed me to the Deftones and Rob Zombie.

Hell, some soundtracks seemed bigger than their actual movies!!!  Maybe it was because I was a new Metallica fan, but when I found out Metallica had a new song coming out for the Mission Impossible 2 soundtrack, buying the CD was more exciting than watching the movie!

Look at The Scorpion King soundtrack!!! Lol!  The movie sucked!!!! But the soundtrack had a great lineup!  That‚Äôs were I discovered the band Breaking Point.

Soundtracks were great values for the money because you got a good variety of music, and some of the bands (like Breaking Point) were relatively unknown.  If you liked their song well enough, you could take a leap of faith and buy their album.

It‚Äôs kind of sad now.  It‚Äôs spring, almost summer‚Ä¶. Dr Strange 2 is in the theater, and there‚Äôs no cardboard display at the local Best Buy advertising a soundtrack for the movie.

Everyone stays for the after credit scenes‚Ä¶ not for the banger song that will define that summer!

Kids these days won‚Äôt get great soundtracks like I got when Spider-man 1 &amp; 2 came out‚Ä¶. Or even Daredevil!!! (Another movie that wasn‚Äôt as good as the soundtrack).

Anyways‚Ä¶ yeah it just occurred to me that they don‚Äôt make soundtracks like they used to and it bums me out‚Ä¶ I guess I‚Äôm starting to sound old! Lol!",0,1652014936

**Standouts: ‚ÄúBuggin‚Äô Out,‚Äù ‚ÄúCheck the Rhime,‚Äù ‚ÄúScenario‚Äù**

What is the low end theory?‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that it‚Äôs a musical theory of evolution, both intensely personal for the members of the now iconic Queens rap group, and much bigger than them. It‚Äôs a philosophy too existential to pin down in a single album, too fluid to fit a fixed definition. Where it‚Äôs consistent is in its essential truth that the essence of everything starts in the bottom; the rumbling bass, the jiggling booty, the awakening of a dormant id.

My name is [Sai Vsr,](https://linktr.ee/saivsr)¬†I am a 20 year old singer/songwriter based out of Hyderabad, India. Here is a quick link to my¬†[artist profile.](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2mBVohASpw940fkhn6UdgM)

I'm writing this post my latest single ""Dear Madeline,"" which is due for¬†release on all streaming platforms on May 27th 2022.

I wrote this song back in September 2021 when I was in a particularly overwhelming stage of my life. I also had a falling out with a close friend of mine at the time, which gave me the idea of writing a song that would signify the weight that unsaid words carry - and the importance behind finally saying those words. In January 2022 I began working on this with¬†[Sidharth Bendi](https://www.sidharthbendi.com/)¬†who produced, mixed, and mastered the single.

The song also features [Pritpal Sudan](https://www.instagram.com/notsudan/)¬†on the guitars and [Kenneth Harrison](https://www.instagram.com/kenneth_harisson/) on the drums.

A lot of work went into the song and I would love it if you could give a quick listen to it using this¬†[SoundCloud link](https://soundcloud.com/saivsr/dear-madeline-private-link/s-BNZjkIHdYv9?utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing).

You can also reach out to me on¬†[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/saivsr/)¬†if you'd like!

Some kanye examples (look them up and then check Spotify), where the artists appear as songwriters but not performers:
- All Mine (ant clemons)
- Famous (rihanna)

Music,ukuy4n,Bandicootrat,1,Contemporary rock music sounds like machine noise,"This is probably going to be very unpopular, and some people might be shocked to read this, but here it is.

&amp;#x200B;

Contemporary rock music sounds like machines that break your ears.

Since the mid-1900s, rock and pop music have pretty much replaced soulful acoustic music not only in the US and UK, but also throughout most of the world. The early 1900s had great natural-sounding music that did not require the use of electric-powered musical instruments. People typically listened to music with actual trumpets, tubas, violins, pianos, accordions, acoustic guitars, and other natural acoustic instruments.

But electric guitars and drums in rock music sound horrible. They sound like car engines and construction sites, or motorcycles or ATVs.

Modern rock music sounds like souless machines screeching and banging.

That's why I enjoy traditional European folk dance music, classical music, and Latin American ranchera music. You can actually hear coherent, soulful melodies. It doesn't sound like vroom vroom, bang bang.

It's hard to explain this to most people who live and breathe contemporary music that cannot exist without electric guitars, drums, and synthesizers. The only people who understand are classicial musicians and old folks born before WW2.

Probably a very unpopular opinion indeed, but does anyone else also think the same way about how contemporary rock music is basically machine noise that breaks your ears?",0,1651987763

2. is it a idea bad to spend $65 or so on a keyboard at first and maybe upgrade later on or should i go ahead and get a $100-$200 keyboard that i can barely afford

Music,ukpdxx,Billbillyboi,1,Lost my faith in fellow young music students,"I have just started a Music A level and was hoping to have found kids I would've found cool in it. Except, I don't like any. We have all got creative differences. And I can appreciate everyone has their different musical focuses yet these dudes aren't even arsed on writing music. Just cover bands, WTF?!

I am a 16 year old musician, into contemporary jazz, alt rock n loads of creative, free and artistic bands in which music is valued as an art. Which I feel it sometimes isn't in most other stuff.

I'm starting to lose my faith in humanity with some kids. They're all just straight cut, boring, play by the rules, refuse to try new creative stuff. 

I have my own three piece jazz/funk band but that's just with my own twin and a musician payed to play with us. So I'm struggling to find people I can jam and just have a good time with sharing key knowledge and interesting contemplations.

Music,ukkd5d,RamonitaHalbert,1,I want to discover new music,"As I grew up, I learned the name of the mainstream artists because my friends were always playing popular songs (like Ariana Grande, Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, Bad Bunny, Daddy Yankee etc.) For whatever reason, these kinds of pop or reggaeton songs never clicked with me, so I didn't ever bother to install Spotify. In my school, my music lessons were basically a joke, and my parents weren't really fond of music either, so my musical knowledge was really poor.

One year ago, however, I met a friend who was a big fan of Imagine Dragons. He introduced me to their music, and I definitely enjoyed it more than most of the other artists I've listened to before. Then, on my own, I started looking for new bands, and I ended up loving songs from groups such as My Chemical Romance, Linkin Park, Fall out Boy, Panic! At the Disco, Coldplay, Green Day or Arctic Monkeys.

Still, now that I'm barely into music, I would like to experiment more genres and find new types of artists, but I don't know where to start.

Music,uki0hy,TopGrun1,1,The Awesome Power of Music,"I lost my son to an overdose four years ago. We shared a love for music, so I often today sense his presence in specific songs and bands. His favorite music genre was what I called, ‚Äúsudden emotion,‚Äù (metalcore) wherein the lead singer laid down a melodic verse and was followed by a secondary singer who sang a verse that resonated from, and this is hard to describe, but from the pits of their soul. Hahaha. I‚Äôve been to hundreds of concerts, heck I‚Äôve even seen Barry Manilow and LOVED it, but metalcore pushed my limits a bit. 

When my son was in high school, I would take him and a buddy of his to concerts. That way he got to listen to the music he loved and I knew he‚Äôd make it home safe. The first concert we went to was Atreyu at the amphitheater in Irvine. I brought some industrial earplugs and a book and sat in the upper level. My son and his buddy went down to the floor level and got an eye opening introduction to the violent beauty of the mosh pit. Needless to say, they had a blast. Meanwhile, about half way through Atreyu‚Äôs set I ditched the earplugs and started listening to the music. Specifically, the song Ex‚Äôs and Oh‚Äôs. The raw power hooked me, and the contrasting vocal styles sealed the deal. I‚Äôve never been able to hear lyrics all that well, instead I‚Äôd get swept up by the melody, so the music fit my ear. Soon after, we were hitting a concert a month. I always gave him and his friend their space, as I didn‚Äôt want to be that weird 50 year old dad in the mosh pit, but I no longer brought a book‚Äîor ear plugs. This went on for a period of around 3 years until drugs took over his life and rendered even his love of music from reaching him.

About a year before my son passed, he was homeless. The choice was his, we‚Äôd always welcomed him at our/his home. The problem was: we welcomed him, but not the drugs. Out of the blue one day I heard a literal ‚Äúvoice in my head‚Äù that told me clearly, ‚Äúgo find your son.‚Äù I immediately got in my pickup and drove several miles to the approximate area I‚Äôd last seen him. I saw what I assumed was a pile of discarded clothes next to the road, which turned out to be him. A true ‚ÄúGod-assisted‚Äù needle in the haystack find. I got him up, threw his stuff in the truck and started for home. We stopped at a Walmart along the way where I bought him a set of new clothes and necessities. I got him home and cleaned him up, but after two or three days, his demons called him back, so he once again ended up out on the street.

Which brings us to yesterday. 

Somewhere on this sub, I saw a recommendation for the song Don‚Äôt Follow by Alice In Chains. Like I said, I don‚Äôt hear lyrics all that well, but the melody and the vocals in that song drew me in instantly. The contrast between Jerry Cantrell‚Äôs haunting voice and the power, and emotion, of Layne Staley‚Äôs verse gripped me. I listened to it on repeat a dozen times, progressively focusing on the lyrics, which I pieced together, but didn‚Äôt fully absorb. I knew Layne Staley‚Äôs story. Honestly, any parent of an addict knows Layne Staley‚Äôs story. Absent the fame and notoriety, my son‚Äôs story is Layne Staley‚Äôs story. Addiction doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about fame, it only seeks a soul.

Around noon yesterday, I went into, of all places, THAT Walmart, which sparked a memory of my son. I did my business and came back to the car. When I turned the key, Jerry Cantrell‚Äôs voice hit my ears and I not only heard what he was saying, but I also FELT it:

Hey, I ain't never coming home.
Hey, I'll just wander my own road.
Hey, hey, I can't meet you here tomorrow, no‚Ä¶
Say goodbye, don't follow.
Misery so hollow.

I‚Äôm instantly snot-bubble, body-rocking, SOBBING. That wasn‚Äôt Jerry Cantrell coming through the speakers, it was MY SON singing to me from the netherworld. I completely lost it in the Walmart parking lot. 

FUCK, I MISS MY SON!

After ten minutes or so of abject misery, I gathered myself and paused to take in what happened. It all comes down to one thing: MUSIC. Somewhere in the mix of strummed guitar strings, air passing across the vocal chords, and 26 letters slung together to form lyrics, there is evidence of a higher presence that can invoke all the emotions known to mortal man. In some way, shape, or form, the concept of God is encompassed in music.

So I‚Äôd like to say THANK YOU to my friends in r/music. Don‚Äôt ever stop, fellow Redditors. You‚Äôre beautiful and this old man worships you for allowing me a moment with my son.

By the way, you owe me a box of fucking Kleenex!

TL; DR: My late son sang to me from the Great Beyond, thanks to the awesome power of music (with an assist by Jerry Cantrell and Alice In Chains.)",0,1651944177

Eminem also bit the styles of Masta Ace, Pharoahe Monch, AZ, Percee P, and Nas when he wrote *Infinite*. And his entire horrorcore shtick was taken straight from Cage and Esham.

Music,ukbddt,MusicaX79,1,Live sound mixing like a video game.,"My apologizes if my vocabulary for this is poor I don't know enough on this concept hopefully I explain this properly.  


Video games have this function where it allows it to piece together portions of a song. It will repeat a section over and over again until you get to a trigger that causes it to play another portion of the song. The chainsaw sound effect portion of songs from Doom (2016) and Doom Eternal are probably the most well known and documented games of this. However I'm looking more for something like Black Mesa's final Gonarch lair fight.   


Where the system played the beginning of the song on a loop until it was given a trigger. At which point it would then look for ""the nearest off ramp"" that lines up with the next portion of the song to be looped. Then it would stop playing the first portion and play the second. When the fight is over it would again look for ""the next ramp"" and then fade out.   


While video games have this function programed in I was wondering if there is an application that does the same thing. Where you can mark up audio files for possible exits and shift from one to the next. 

Thanks in advance for any information.",0,1651923101

Doja Cat has released a new tune named ‚ÄòVegas,‚Äô which is taken from Baz Luhrmann‚Äôs upcoming Elvis biopic soundtrack.

Doja‚Äôs new single, which was released on 6th¬†May, reinvents the well-known song, which was first performed by blues musician Big Mama Thornton in 1952 and famously covered by Elvis Presley four years later. The rapper incorporates Thornton‚Äôs vocal samples into her cover, as well as her own blazing bars and a cutting trap rhythm.

Music,uk95ou,AdOdd6435,1,Taylor Swift Re-Recorded Her Rendition of ‚ÄòThis Love‚Äô from 1989," 

This Love (Taylor‚Äôs Version)‚Äô is another track from Taylor Swift‚Äôs rework of the 2014 album ‚Äò1989‚Äô. Taylor Swift took to social media to announce the track‚Äôs arrival on 6th May.

It came with a lyric video that featured a length of boardwalk surrounded by swaying grasses and a dusky blue sky, with the song‚Äôs lyrics fading in and out across it. Look it up below.

 The song was first featured in the trailer for an OTT‚Äôs new show ‚ÄòThe Summer I Turned Pretty‚Äô. Swift confirmed that the re-recorded tune would be released in full later, writing on social media that she has always been incredibly proud of this song.

‚ÄúEvery time that I sell myself to you
I feel a little bit cheaper than I need to‚Äù this is the first line and it sounds like she is referring to whenever she has relations with this guy she feels like she‚Äôs selling herself to him not doing it with any kind of will but nevertheless it happens again and again. She‚Äôs saying she feels cheaper than she needs to because she knows deep down inside she‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt deserve this.
‚ÄúEvery time that I stare into the sun
Angel dust and my dress just comes undone
Every time that I stare into the sun
Be a model or just look like one
Wild eye rot gut do me in
Do you think you can make me do it again?‚Äù This part is a mixture of poetry and honest upfront truth. She‚Äôs saying we‚Äôre told to look a certain way or be a certain thing. She‚Äôs also saying ‚Äúdo you think you can make me do it again?‚Äù Rhetorically, the answer is no.
‚ÄúIf you live through this with me
I swear that I would die for you
And if you live through this with me
I swear that I would die for you‚Äù to me this sounds like another woman who possibly had the same thing happen with the same guy has told her about it and Courtney is saying that it‚Äôs okay and you spoke up, your safe sharing it with me were in this together.

Music,uk5drt,RedHeadReviews,1,Jack Harlow‚Äôs Come Home The Kids Miss You Is Low On Energy And Originality - Album Review,"Jack Harlow the media personality and Jack Harlow the musician are two completely different entities. When the cameras are rolling, the laidback coolness Harlow has made his only notable musical trait blossoms into an irreverent character that is responsible for coining a number of the decades' fads. So far, that‚Äôs been enough to keep the name Jack Harlow in your head - something his music is yet to do. Despite this, *First Class* was the first song Harlow released where I felt he wasn‚Äôt making music for music's sake. The hit has a sub-three-minute runtime and uses nostalgia via a sample as its salient selling point, making it an ideal specimen in the TikTok climate. 

Harlow certainly isn‚Äôt the first major artist to tailor his music to recent consumer trends, but he‚Äôs among the most careless with the way he goes about it. *Come Home The Kids Miss You*, Harlow‚Äôs sophomore album, is low on energy and originality. When he isn‚Äôt copying Drake (who appears on the album), Harlow is ripping himself off in order to repeat the ludicrous levels of success he‚Äôs garnered. 

If you don‚Äôt have the resilience to sit through a 45-minute Jack Harlow album, everything there is to know about the Louisville rapper can be gleaned from the two singles *Nail Tech* and *First Class*. The former credits eight different people as producers but ends up jacking its swinging brass melody from a song Harlow has already been involved with. Without Lil Nas X to hold his hand, however, Harlow is unremarkable in the *INDUSTRY BABY* sequel. And on *First Class*, he names luxuries that are so commonly brought up that Harlow makes being rich sound like a chore. It is a sour reminder of how he has departed from his light-hearted roots.     

Just three years ago, with *Confetti*, Harlow‚Äôs goal was to put his hometown on the map. That mixtape had purpose, it tried to pay homage to the streets and artists Harlow knew best. *Come Home The Kids Miss You*, on the other hand, is indistinct. Throughout, the production is breezy, guided by midi loops and plain percussion patterns. It‚Äôs the sort of repetitive, greyscale slapdash you‚Äôd expect to hear on an anonymous SoundCloud user‚Äôs self-produced album. Worst of all, any substitute could rap over these beats with the same half-hearted demeanor Harlow affects.  

*Dua Lipa* is the album‚Äôs most frustrating song. Not because it sounds bad, but because Harlow shows supreme technical ability only when the possibility of creating a few headlines and hashtags emerges. On the chorus, light on his feet like a dancer, he goes, *‚ÄúDua Lipa, I'm tryna do more with her than do a feature‚Äù*, vehemently. He coasts for the rest of the song. Other superstars show up, Justin Timberlake, who hasn‚Äôt released solo music since 2018, sounds out of place isolated on the chorus on *Parent Trap* and Lil Wayne mumbles his way through his verse on *Poison*. Neither of these active participants gets energy out of Harlow in the same way his fantasy does.   

The public name-drop is a move straight out of Drake‚Äôs rule book. The two have been pictured together as of late and it‚Äôs clear during their time shared, that more has rubbed onto Harlow than just the Canadian womanizers' sleaze. Not only does he enlist Drake for *Churchill Downs*, but he also mimics the melancholy from his *Take Care* era. The most interesting revelation to come from the five minutes they share is the chronicling of Drake‚Äôs ongoing feud with Pusha T. *Side Piece* is dressed up with all the conventions of a Drake song, too; a beat-switch, a vengeful partner, trouble with personal psychosis, but the *‚Äúgrown-up shit‚Äù* (his words) just doesn‚Äôt suit Harlow.    

His best songs have always perched somewhere between fun and fine. The song closest to recreating the exuberance of *WHATS POPPIN* is the Pharrell-assisted *Movie Star*. Harlow‚Äôs singing voice, somehow meeker than the one he raps with, is smothered by the bleeps and bloops of the bouncy beat, but when the listening experience is genuinely fun, who cares? His connections serve him well on closer *State Fair*, too, where Harlow‚Äôs shallow recreation of his birthplace is sheathed by a soothing flute melody that wouldn‚Äôt sound out of place on *Flower Boy*. But these are anomalies on an album that is otherwise strictly curated to make sure his music remains uniform to keep his trajectory that way.

Hip-hop can be unforgiving with how fast it moves. Before a big-name artist can capitalize on a trend it‚Äôs likely already nearing staleness. The pursuit of the next Jack Harlow never ceases. What‚Äôs keeping this current iteration of Harlow at the top, though, is sheer persistence. He‚Äôs been all over everything since *Thats What They All Say*, which is precisely why *Come Home The Kids Miss You* is so ineffective. Harlow‚Äôs album about being rich comes too soon after his last one. On behalf of all of the kids, we didn‚Äôt miss this.

Music,uk20hq,44faced,1,"NoKissing - GreenEyes &amp; EyeLiner [Singer-Songwriter, Alternative]","**NoKissing, evokes depth and delicacy in his newly-released single, ""GreenEyes &amp; EyeLiner,"" which came to fruition after a string of recent singles releases.**

The single emerges as the latest unraveling of the American singer-songwriter's (from Detroit, MI) soul-searching through his wide range of genre-bending influences from Kurt Cobain to Juice WRLD. Each of his releases are stepping stones on a journey increasingly revealing an introspective expansion of the artist‚Äôs mind and heart.

Shrouded in secrecy, outside NoKissing's melodic outpourings, he discloses nothing more than bite-sized fragments about his music, which serve more as hints rather than clarifications. About the single, NoKissing's few words of self-description are as concise as they are a question mark in and of themselves, that ""this song is ambient, upbeat, with reflective subject matter.""

Taking these questions into the release, together with visually-arousing lyrics, attention-demanding voice, enticing bridges, a catchy hook within smooth production, the listener encounters a floating motion, melancholy blended with beauty, reflecting the confrontation between the mind‚Äôs paradoxes and the emotional release that the music provides both artist and listener.

""GreenEyes &amp; EyeLiner"" comes as a major artistic milestone for NoKissing, after his recent single release, ""Leave Me Alone,"" and the music videos for his captivating singles, ‚ÄúBADTHING‚Äù featuring MVRV, and ""GreenDay,"" the latter of which has racked up over 51K views on YouTube to this day.

Music,uk10w2,UnguidedAndMisused,1,What was it about the 90s metal and alt legends that made them all feel so much darker and grittier than what we get these days?,"Everything you hear today sounds too clean and inviting until you get more into the underground hardcore and metal. I remember the first time hearing bands like Alice In Chains, lamb of god, Nine Inch Nails, Tool, slipknot and Korn, etc and holy crap.. It felt almost like I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be listening to it, but it drew me in. As if I could really feel the darkness and emotion in the bands lives. Truly feel and understand the songs meaning, not just with the vocalists, but with the entire band. Everything just felt so close to home in its own way back in those older peak albums of the bands previously mentioned. You just don‚Äôt really get that raw grit anymore in the main stream. Kids wouldn‚Äôt roll around in muddy shit to see a band like they play on the radio these days. I wonder what happened‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs all these old classic rock dudes not trying to explore raw unseen unfiltered underground bands.",0,1651882199

Self taught, spent five years finding my style transitioning from to another with a total of 3 before I settled with the one I have now which I‚Äôm quite satisfied with and feels like ‚Äúme‚Äù the most.

Granted there are some specific artists that have influenced me a bit but I think that‚Äôs to be expected of a self taught singer who loves listening to a lot of music.

And it seems that people are divided about this. Some say to find your own voice and don‚Äôt try to imitate others at all and some say the opposite, I personally think that doing both is the best way to do it.

I did try to imitate them back then in terms of how they did certain things like belting and such, I eventually went a few steps back and use them as stepping stones in order to discover how to do those things in the context of my own voice.

They brought up certain names that I don‚Äôt even sound like and I find it odd that the ones that influenced me don‚Äôt get brought up.

Should I let that concern me?",0,1651874918

For example, when I hear the first major hits of Adele ""Someone Like You"" and ""Rolling In The Deep"" or perhaps Lady Gaga's ""Bad Romance"" or ""Poker Face"", or Psy's ""Gangnam Style"" it feels like the songs are still new, like they were released yesterday - like no time passed between then and now.

Hello everyone, I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to put this in, however I'm not sure where else. 

My father was a musician who passed away of a heart attack back in January and due to COVID restrictions here in Canada we pushed a funeral off and instead are doing a celebration of life this month. I have been struggling to find a good quote or poem or something for the back of the memorial cards for the event.

I'm looking for something music related because music was his life. He was nominated for a Juno back in the 70s (Canadian Grammys for those unfamiliar) and I was hoping someone here might be like minded and aware of something suitable for such an event.

Of course if this is too broad of a sub please point me to one that might be better. Cheers and thank you so much for any consideration.

TL;DR My dad passed away and we need a quote or poem for a memorial card. He was an accomplished musician in Canada so I would like something music related.",0,1651849554

Music,ujoiha,Ok_Fly_1404,1,Does anybody want to help with my research on alternative rock?,"&amp;#x200B;

Hello people of reddit,

I have an assignment i need to do for college in which I need to research how to promote concerts for  
a relatively unknown creator. I got assigned to research Ghostpoet a.k.a Obaro Ejimiwe. He is from the UK and makes alternative rock music since 2009. Part of this assignment was interviewing people in the target audience.

It would really help me if you could answer the questions below. I would really appreciate the help. If you don't like posting your answers publicly for whatever reason you can always dm me. You can skip any question if you are uncomfortable with answering it. These questions are purely meant for research for my assignment and I will not do anything with the answers except use them as data in my assignment.

Here are my questions:

**Survey questions**

1. How old are you?
2. As what gender do you identify?
3. In what area of the world do you live?
4. to what artists do you listen most often?
5. Do you know any of the following artists or bands?

* Mount Kimbie
* Wild Beasts
* Baxter Dury
* SUUNS
* Young Fathers
* Burial
* Gonjasufi
* Roots Manuva

**Interview questions**

1. Did you already know you know who ghostpoet is before the interview? If so; Do/ did you actively listen to his music?
2. how do you think alternative rock can be best described?
3. Which artist introduced you to this genre? Why Was their music so compelling to you?
4. Who is your favorite artist and why?
5. How important are lyrics for you when you listen to music?
6. If you go to concerts what is your primary reason to go?(The music itself, The artist, the atmosphere)
7. Would you go to concerts more often if there would be pre-events
8. What would your ideal alternative-rock concert be?
9. Do you have a favorite album cover? If so, Which one?

Thank you in advance for answering my questions. I really appreciate it.

TL;DR I need to research fans of the alternative-rock genre for a college assignement.",0,1651846741

Music,ujn37i,kururong,1,Jack White's the Upholsterers,"I remember back then that I use to read Wikipedia of my favorite artists. I remember back then that Jack White former band created 100 vinyls that they hid on their upholstered furniture. And I didn't know that it was already found out long ago. And for the Upholsterers, they are rough but still like their music.

And this reminds me of a Pink Floyd's Division bell, where they said that if you answer the riddle, you will get a reward. It is not solved this day, and many said that it was a hoax.

And another little note: Jack White version of Jolene sounds slightly similar to the 33 rpm slowed down version. I have a hunch that he already knew the slowed down version because he's a huge fan of vinyl experimentation.

Now this time, which foreign songs or non-English songs are in your opinion, the ‚Äúworst offenders‚Äù? Also doing this to broaden my music tastes.

I‚Äôll start with a KPop song from a group called Aespa. The song is called *Next Level* and though the label that manages them (SM Entertainment), is known for experimenting a lot in their songs. I just can‚Äôt comprehend why they chose to do a mash up of a beat driven pop track with some kind of jazz then back to that pop track. The cohesion is lacking imo

And another KPop song from a group called Miss A. The song is called *Only You* and if you listen closely, you can hear some sort of yelling or screaming in the background that doesn‚Äôt add anything to the song. Kinda eerie tbh",0,1651841405

Music,uji084,i_owe_them13,1,Getting over vocal stage fright.,"Hey all! It‚Äôs Friday so I‚Äôm pretty sure this post is okay (right?). Basically, the title is pretty self explanatory, and I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs much additional info needed. But I can give the spark notes version:

&amp;nbsp;

As much as I downplay it in person, there‚Äôs no denying it: I can sing. Like, really well. But I can‚Äôt seem to do it in front of people, or whenever I think about how someone might hear me. I‚Äôve been trying to break myself out of this shell by singing short snippets of a song with others in the car or, when there‚Äôs no accompanying music, singing longer bits quietly and trying to increase my volume. I don‚Äôt know if any of that is working.

&amp;nbsp;

My mom has been living with me for a few months, and I can‚Äôt do vocals like I used to when she‚Äôs here. I didn‚Äôt think twice before, but now if she‚Äôs even in the house I‚Äôm so self conscious about it.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I love to imagine myself on a stage behind a piano belting out one of my songs‚Äînot always thinking big, just in packed a bar or coffee shop even‚Äîbut I know if I can‚Äôt get across this bizarre psychological canyon I‚Äôll never be able to experience that.

&amp;nbsp;

I‚Äôm nearing a point in my life where it‚Äôs now or never if I want my music to be heard, felt, and have the biggest impact on the most people (I might be wrong about this, but its been gnawing on me for a few months).

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway‚Ä¶any practical advice or tips on how to get past this would be appreciated. Anyone else ever go through this? How did you get through it?",0,1651822014

Music,ujf8or,LiteralFakeNews,1,"I‚Äôm a 40 year old man who mainly listens to 70s-90s hard rock, metal and grunge. I just discovered Halsey‚Äôs latest album, and it‚Äôs one of the best new albums I‚Äôve heard this century.","Title says it all, really.  I‚Äôm a big fan of Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Metallica, Guns N‚Äô Roses, Nirvana, Alice In Chains‚Ä¶ stuff like that.  But those bands either no longer exist, or put out their best material decades ago.

The only bands that became popular this century that I really liked are System Of A Down, The White Stripes, The Black Keys, and Ghost.  But the first two are gone, and the third is wildly inconsistent.  Ghost is awesome, though.  Overall, though, I‚Äôm stuck in a musical rut.

Fortuitously, I was browsing a certain NSFW subreddit focusing on full-frontal nude pictures of celebrities, and happened upon one or two featuring singer Halsey.  I wondered what that was about, and discovered they were from a feature-length film released to promote her latest album.  An album that was produced and co-written by ‚Ä¶Trent Reznor?  I‚Äôm intrigued.

I knew ‚ÄúBad At Love,‚Äù and wasn‚Äôt much of a fan.  Seemed fairly generic to me.  But the thing that I really didn‚Äôt like were the vocals, which reminded me of Ellie Goulding, and that awful song from the Fifty Shades of Grey films.  So, I had low expectations.

My expectations were met, mainly because I couldn‚Äôt get past the vocal style.  Except for the third track, ‚ÄúEasier Than Lying,‚Äù which has a very loud, shouted, uptempo chorus that really grabbed me on the first listen.  But one song does not a good album make.

I added the song to my library and listened to it a few more times.  I started to notice new things on each listen.  A brutal industrial-flavored screech in the first chorus.  The instrumental swell at the end that could have been lifted from a song on NIN‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Fragile.‚Äù  Could this catchy pop song have more layers than I thought?

I decide to give the album another listen.  I start to get past my instinctive dislike of the vocals.  I notice more things I like.  I find myself singing along to a chorus or two.  I find myself turning the volume up more.  Some of these riffs really do grab you.  I turn the volume up more.  I start belting out that I am not a woman, I‚Äôm a god, as I let the song‚Äôs building synth riffs wash over me.  I add the entire album to my library.

I timidly told a friend about it, who has similar tastes to me but is pretty open-minded.  He said it was the best NIN album he‚Äôd heard in 20 years.  A little facetious, as it‚Äôs clearly not a NIN album, but he did like it.  I now find myself listening to it every day, often more than once.

There are probably only about 15 albums released this century that I‚Äôve enjoyed pretty much all the way through and considered to be among my favorites.  But, this might be #16.  I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôve enjoyed a *pop* album this much in‚Ä¶ forever, not that I listen to many pop albums in their entirety.  But, no matter how much it may differ from what I usually like, a great album is a great album, and I‚Äôm glad to have found something that expands my musical horizons a bit.",0,1651810552

Music,ujbjhb,ExPatBadger,1,Do we have a name yet for this musical trope?,"The next Millennial Whoop?

I've been hearing this clich√© a lot lately, and I'm wondering if it is common enough where it merits a name.  The musical clich√© is what I'd call a ""playground 'yeah!',"" usually on the 4 just prior to a new verse.  

Recent example: [Galantis x Roxette's ""Fading Like a Flower"" at the 1:20 mark](https://youtu.be/Mk4C9ynvXaI?t=78) and multiple other times throughout the song.

Catchy as hell, but officially starting to grate on me.

Have we collectively noticed this enough where it deserves a name?

What should we call this trope?",0,1651798068
Music,ujbixt,Successful_Impact22,2,Top 500 Albums ~ Music Challenge ~ HALFWAY,"So, at the beginning of the pandemic (when there wasn't much to do) I decided to embark upon a music journey. Rather than listening to the same things on repeat, I wanted to expand my knowledge of music and listening behavior.

For this 'challenge', I went to the Rolling Stone magazine and pulled up the list of their Top 500 albums: 
https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/arcade-fire-%ef%bb%bffuneral-1062733/

Now, I don't think it's really possible to truly ""rank"" music because it is so so subjective, but with their updated list covering a broader range of music styles, I figured it would be a good list to listen to. For the record, I don't think their list is what I would necessarily choose, but I'm happy to have found some great new music nonetheless.

I started at 1 (Marvin Gaye's, ""What's Going On"") and have officially reached 250 (Buzzcocks ""Singles Going Steady"").

Now, that I'm halfway, I want some album recommendations from you all!

I realize that these rankings leave out wonderful albums and aren't always diverse enough in their lists, so I want to take a break from this list and hear some new stuff that you think is good!

Here is a Google Sheet, so you can easily see the albums in order* (I made this list as I was going along for fun and left a comment for each album - the comments don't always indicate the overall felling of the album, some are just fun facts I learned): 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vzYPdHE1u1DwyZN9UWyNLNmajqj83OwsD9LXGEAhdKk/edit?usp=sharing

2. Only six or seven acts out of the thousands of genuinely quality rock acts are inducted every year; some will *have* to be left out. That's how numbers work. Not everyone can have their way.
3. Some inductees are assholes or ""problematic"", so inducting them would cause the RARHOF's reputation to take a hit, thus they pander by inducting people like Eminem.
4. Almost all inductees are nominated by previous inductees, meaning they don't often align with what the public want. The hall is basically a circlejerk for that reason. You probably shouldn't be so worried about who's in, it's basically meaningless.

There, hopefully now we won't have to see any more of these repetitive god-awful posts.",0,1651795843

**Backstory:** I grew up listening to the radio and could only afford to buy a few CD's. Eventually I was listening/making mixed CD's and downloading songs on Limewire. Then eventually Spotify came. Basically my whole life I have never really listened to full albums, just singles.

A few years ago, I bought a record player and it has completely changed how I listen to music. I also realized I love so many albums from the 60's, 70's and 80's. I am now making a list of all the albums I never listened to and giving them a try!

Music,uj3fte,_9tail_,1,Is any song title as stacked as ‚ÄúCalifornia‚Äù?,"I‚Äôve recently come to realise just how stacked the song title ‚ÄúCalifornia‚Äù is\*. Obviously there‚Äôs the phantom planet classic, and its many covers, perhaps most notably by Lisa Mitchell. But then Lana Del Ray, Lorde, Grimes, CHVCHES, James Blunt, YUNGBLUD and Childish Gambino have all made songs of the name, many of which are pretty enjoyable, and others which are the Childish Gambino version.

Sons of the East have a version, as does Polish Rapper White 2115 with 55million Spotify plays. 88rising, Ricky Montgomery, the Lagoons, Oliver Tree, girlfriend. This list really does go on and on, I‚Äôve barely scratched the surface. And this absolutely isn‚Äôt mentioning the plethora of songs containing ‚ÄúCalifornia‚Äù, because then we really would be here all day.

So my question. Is there any other exact song title with quite so many completely different, high quality songs as ‚ÄúCalifornia‚Äù?

Even accounting for the fact that a lot of these are B-side songs, I just can‚Äôt think of another title that contains so many versions by top artists. By my count ‚ÄúCalifornia‚Äù has at least one smash hit, at least a couple famous versions, and at least 6/7 big songs, on top of plenty more depth beyond that.

Also, what‚Äôs your favourite ‚ÄúCalifornia‚Äù?

Music,uj0kjl,AGalhardi,1,My Chemical Romance's musical legacy was harmed by their own fanbase.,"I have this habit of sometimes revisiting music trends that I was not alive to be a part of and/or went under my radar for some reason and trying to expand my musical spectrum. For some reason, I recently obsessed over 2000's Rock/Punk and have been listening to a lot of it. Honestly, there's a lot of garbage in that genre. Of course, there's also a lot of good/great stuff. Nothing, however, stuck with me as much as MCR's ""The Black Parade"" album. I listened to it a least 100 times by now and, yes, I consider it a masterpiece that should be up there in the highest echelons of Rock music. 

Being the nerd that I am, I researched everything I could about the Album, its musical references, and MCR's status at the time, and I landed on this conclusion: TBP will never reach its potential as a classic because of their incredibly obnoxious and, frankly, very weird fanbase that didn't allow people (especially older people at the time) to see the project as anything other than another Emo album. I understand the importance and ideas behind the emo movement but there's an enormous gap between that and glamorizing suicide, self-harm, and depression. Of course, there are people that just really enjoy the music and consider themselves fans, but a good portion of the MCR cult is not composed of this type. 

Of course, I'm not saying MCR is not popular. TBP is their most commercially successful album and songs like ""Teenagers"" are well known by everyday people. My argument concerns legacy (a central point of the Album's musical and lyrical themes, btw) and how this project will probably never have the status it deserves among music enthusiasts.

I'm sure that this has happened before and after with other artists (Nirvana?). Stan culture is a part of the internet musical landscape and has definitely harmed the mass appeal of some good projects. I'm also conscious that MCR's dedicated fanbase also hugely helped their careers and there's a chance I might have never heard one of their songs if not for their support.",0,1651766164

Music,uizp3u,DaBurdIzDaWurd,1,Is it safe to assume that most singers after the birth of autotune in 1997 have some level of pitch correction on their vocals?,"This question is more specifically for music groups during that time especially boy bands like Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC.

I was listening to some stuff from the 70s to 90s and I‚Äôve observed the difference of how harmony layers and backing vocals were processed during those times.

Songs from the Jackson 5 and Michael Jackson‚Äôs solo stuff had harmonies that sound way looser and you can hear how many takes of the same harmony they recorded (e.g double tracked harmonies to be panned symmetrically on the stereo field).

Then we had Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC but unlike the former two, the processing from the vocal layers sound so tight that you won‚Äôt even notice that there‚Äôs two takes of the same line and instead, feels like one voice.

I read that in order to do this, timing accuracy is needed which I believe can be done pre digital processing (?) and then we had pitch accuracy where autotune for pitch correction comes in.

Are they just really good at singing the same line as identical as possible with only microtonal differences? Did they record multiple takes until they got 2 that could work? Was there autotune involved and something like Vocalign?",0,1651763741

Self taught, spent five years finding my style transitioning from to another with a total of 3 before I settled with the one I have now which I‚Äôm quite satisfied with and feels like ‚Äúme‚Äù the most.

Granted there are some specific artists that have influenced me a bit but I think that‚Äôs to be expected of a self taught singer who loves listening to a lot of music. 

And it seems that people are divided about this. Some say to find your own voice and don‚Äôt try to imitate others at all and some say the opposite, I personally think that doing both is the best way to do it.

 I did try to imitate them back then in terms of how they did certain things like belting and such, I eventually went a few steps back and use them as stepping stones in order to discover how to do those things in the context of my own voice.

They brought up certain names that I don‚Äôt even sound like and I find it odd that the ones that influenced me don‚Äôt get brought up.

Music,uiuxbz,Severe-Vehicle,1,Bob Dylan Explanation,"It's fair to question ""Bob"" in regards to his vocal presentation. It's fair to conclude that he may be overrated, in regards to his reputation as the best songwriter of all time. It's fair to read ""Chronicles: Volume One"" and appreciate his writing but still, somehow, reserve your appreciation...

But it's impossible to listen to his original ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door"" and not love what Bob made and what he did for music. Forget your opinions and listen to a song that's been covered thousands of times- sung to absolute perfection by the man himself. An all-time perfect song that clocks in at 2:30.

It's still got some great tracks on it but I think Surrender is better. It's difficult as ur measuring against the first two albums which were fantastic. I think 2005s Push the Button was a major letdown. Of course it had a few good tracks like Galvanise, Hold tight London and come inside but overall the album was very scrappy. I liked the chemical Brothers because they made interesting electronic music and they just used too many guests on tracks .

Alicia Keys in her song No One being kinda flat especially in the chorus. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs intentional but if it is, I guess in kinda works in the context of the song but hearing it on earphones for the first time (though I heard multiple times on the radio already), it just feels odd especially when the harmonies come in.

Music,uitkst,Amselcom,1,"Phaune - Cicada - [Downtempo, Electronica]","Cicada is the name of an insect that makes a very familiar summer sound. I used this sound in the first version of the track as percussion but I eventually removed it as it was taking too much space. Every track that I make starts with an intention that is quite different from the outcome and sometimes even the founding elements are replaced. In this case, the cicada sound inspired me in the entire process but was no longer needed when the track could live by itself.

Ninon Corpet is a friend of mine. She‚Äôs not a professional singer but I thought that her voice would fit well with the universe of this track. Ninon‚Äôs high pitched voice matches with the fairy-like atmosphere that I wanted to achieve for Cicada.

This is the only Phaune track with a voice. I spontaneously write only instrumental music. I like voices but I‚Äôm not very comfortable using them and I don't write lyrics. But this time, it just felt like the thing to do. Also this track has a certain pop feeling I think. It is therefore drifting a bit away from my universe.

I wanted to create a ‚Äúfunky forest‚Äù feeling. I like when music feels inhabited with living forms. This is where my alias comes from. Electronic music is a great way to create fantasy worlds that you can populate with funny creatures. Though the sounds refer mostly to vegetal stuff, some of them sound like animals to me.

- They play a massive mix of genres in their albums (rock, rap, funk, soul, classical, jazz, metal, electronic music), and have mix of these and other genres in their albums, and even in one song.

- I can't remember, but either a song, an album or even their band name has the word ""Elephant"" in it somewhere.¬† Possibly with a colour (blue, orange, pink I think?) as the adjective (*Orange Elephant*/*Blue Elephant* etc)

- Their songs are kinda long (4-9 minutes)?

- They have a fair few members I think?

- They're at least 15 years old (heard their songs in 2006-7-8)

- They have instruments like the sitar etc in *some* of their songs.¬†

- They have at least 1 album iirc

I went there for the first time physically last year as a bit of fun since my work was paying me to work half an hour away, and I fell in love. 

Problem is, I live about 3 hours away, and since it's not cool for companies to tell how much potential future employees would make, I have no clue if they'd come anywhere near the amount I'd need just to move down there. My other issue is I'm unsure how good they expect an employee to be. To be honest, I'm more of a producer than I am a traditional musician, but they're currently hiring someone to create content based on DJ/production gear, which I would adore! But I don't know if the example they'd expect would be something with 50 layers or a simple tune with 10. 

Any input would be appreciated.",0,1651726218

I wanna tell you bout the flaws in my broken shell

And only then you will see why I‚Äôm so unwell 

Ugh, but honestly none of that matters
I heard that life can be a mix And I made a cake with the batter

Of something greater than myself so don‚Äôt turn the page

You‚Äôre an addict for the art and just need a quick fix 

We‚Äôre all lonely, and some result to boo‚Äôs

So let's flip that and look backwards. Of all the current members, which single band or musician is the least deserving of the honor? Some complain that rap artists, country artists and jazz musicians don't belong, but what about marginal rock acts that were inducted solely because they were the critic's darlings?

Music,uikiyz,Martipar,1,Speakers matter.,"So I was on my laptop earlier listening to the radio while playing a game on my laptop, a song came on and I left the game to check the title, it was Knights And Heroes by Crystallion.   
I thought it was pretty good and listened to it via my desktop speakers after I stopped playing as they are higher fidelity and are much louder, it sounded OK and not as good as I expected. 

The singer was clearer but the clarity highlighted that she wasn't exactly amazing. On the whole I was unimpressed. I have experienced this before with artists sounding better or worse on better equipment but not to this degree, probably because my laptop speakers are just a bit shit.   


So if you have only listened to artists via your phone, small earphones, a laptop and haven't got anything better I suggest having a look at something better, you don't even have to break the bank, my desktop speakers were ¬£5 used, I don't use them for serious music listening as I have my hi-fi for that but they are good enough to highlight the details of a song.   


What i'm trying to say i0s that it's all about clarity, my hi-fi is like looking at a piece of art with my current glasses on, my laptop is like looking at the art with my glasses off and my desktop speakers/my bathroom speaker (which is of equal quality and made by the same manufacturer) is like wearing my old glasses - I can see but it's not exactly 20/20 vision.",0,1651709686

I was doing some research on Music Discover, and I found that people's main complaint is that it takes too long to find new music you love or it takes a long time to sift through all of the boring music before finding a gem.

This was the core insight that led me to start developing a new way to shorten music.

If you'd like I can email over a sample playlist (just provide your favorite genre+2 songs) using the shortening algorithm to test out.

Sign up for the waitlist below if you are interested and I'd love any comments/criticisms :)

Music,uibhwn,thefactualprophet,1,Eminem does not belong in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.,"Eminem isn‚Äôt the only one who doesn‚Äôt belong there. I think Jay-Z, LL Cool J, NWA, Notorious BIG, Public Enemy, and 2Pac all don‚Äôt belong there. Why? They‚Äôve made little to no contributions to rock and roll. They are all rappers.

I‚Äòd like to note that I am a huge fan of rap music and I like seeing these artists get recognition. But isn‚Äôt there a hip hop hall of fame out there somewhere? These rappers belong there, not a rock and roll hall of fame.

I definitely listen to it regularly, but with the other cheaper music providers out there I was willing to do without.

Called them to cancel, got tossed cheaper offer after cheaper offer. They WOULD NOT take no for an answer. Fast forward 10 minutes on the phone with their customer service and now my yearly bill is just under $100.

I want everyone (who wants too) to make a TOP 20 SONGS OF ALL TIME playlist. This can be anything, no judgement. It can be sentimental or just a badass jam. Please TAKE YOUR TIME. Try to rank from 1 to 20 (best to well 20th best). I don't want to see or hear anyone say they have a list in the first 2 weeks. I want this to take at least a month of your time to let the music sit, stew, make changes, revisions. Memory is a fickle thing. If anyone has questions, comments, or ideas please feel free to tag me and I will take a look. I know we all have similar taste but honestly our genres range widely.    So the end goal is to get everyone together and listen to everyone go through their list (not fully). snippets here and there, explanation of certain songs on the list, etc. And have a good time hanging out. So please, enjoy this, take your time, visit some old tracks, some deep cuts. I think this will be interesting.    HAPPY LISTENING!!!

Anyway. I hope people have fun with this! I am getting a lot of positive feedback from our participants. :)",0,1651663592

Music,ui3s7d,speeb,1,Challenge: Create a single awesome album from a multi-disc release,"Yesterday's ""Civil War"" post reminded me of this recent discussion with friends.

Guns N Roses *Use Your Illusion* albums have been a part of my life since they were released. I love them. But what songs would have made a kickass single album following Appetite and Lies? Friends and I all had some overlap, but some good differences.

Opening it up to other artists and albums: 

**Make the best single disc album (under 74 minutes) you can from a multi-disc project.**

Here's my *Use Your Illusion*. I intentionally left off anything where Duff or Izzy took on vocals as part of my own rules for it even though that meant leaving off some of my favorites.

1. Dead Horse	(4:17)
2. Back Off Bitch	(5:03)
3. Shotgun Blues	(3:23)
4. Yesterdays	(3:17)
5. Right Next Door to Hell	 (3:02)
6. You Could Be Mine	(5:44)
7. Don't Damn Me	(5:18)
8. Locomotive	(8:43)
9. Estranged	(9:24)
10. Perfect Crime	(2:23)
11. Pretty Tied Up	(4:48)
12. Coma	(10:16)
13. Breakdown	(7:05)

I immediately fell in love with their insane talent and musicianship. All members are amazing musicians and have great chemistry within the band. Please check this live gig at the Metropolis Studios in 2020. Their mix of (prog) rock and jazz is noticeable in most of their songs. Please give these guys a listen and the appreciation they deserve (IMO).

It's phenomenal and anyone who is a casual Stones fan or someone who likes live rock albums I'd say it's a must listen. 

The interplay of guitar between Keith Richards and Mick Taylor is incredible, Mick Jagger absolutely delivers along with Bill (Bass) and Charlie (Drums) sound as tight as ever. It also sounds really clear which is a miracle considering other live recordings around the time.

Without getting into an argument about whether or not pop music is good (because I can‚Äôt be bothered to argue with one million Justin Bieber fans), I can instead make a statement which cannot be argued with. Modern Pop music that you hear on the radio is driven by consumerism. What I mean by this is that thee objective is to make as much music as possible with as little money as possible. I can think of many examples but perhaps the most important one is that music theory has been dumbed down to a formula which any musician (or non-musician) could follow to make a catchy song.

By doing this, chord progressions in modern pop music are NOT an example of ‚Äúthe expression or application of human creative skill and imagination.‚Äù This also applies to rhythm where you can hear the same drums in many different songs, and many other elements.

Since creativity is defined as ‚Äúthe use of imagination or original ideas to create something; inventiveness.‚Äù And art is an application of creativity, and pop music is built around purposefully restricting creative freedom.
This begs the question; is Modern Pop music (the kind you hear on the radio) a real art?",0,1651605606

So, yeah, I kinda feel like I'm in front of a cliff and ready to jump into the water.

Music,uhir13,mikewongar,1,Do I Enjoy Music In A Weird Way?,"Hi all, I looked through the rules and I don't think this is violating, but I understand if this question is not ""directly"" related to music.

Basically, I have never found listening to music to be fulfilling on its own. Sitting down and listening to an album, or putting music on to do chores or while I'm driving around has never been that enjoyable, and I am consistently... disappointed in myself? for not ""appreciating"" the art form in the way that most of my peers and just people in general seem to do.

I always use music very mechanically, and functionally. I basically only find myself listening to two types of music, very hype and energetic hip hop like Run The Jewels or Denzel Curry, or softer more melancholic indie rock like Peach Pit or Beach Bunny. Writing is my favorite hobby/pastime, so if I'm writing something with a heavy dose of one of those two moods I will put that kind of music on. Not out of enjoyment but just to put my head into that kind of framework. I also use soundtracks a lot from this, namely Animal Crossing: New Horizon if I'm writing something more light and fun, or Mr. Robot if I'm writing something intense and moody.

I'll get into a loop with particular songs that make me feel a certain type of way, right now that's Black Sheep off the Scott Pilgrim soundtrack, but I can never sustain interest in a style or artist to continually listen to music for pleasure, just when I need or want to feel a particular emotion, and when that song is burned out I generally stop listening to music regularly until a different song hooks me and the pattern repeats.

This has never been a huge problem for me. Recently though, I feel like I've been missing out. If I have the opportunity to put on music for coworkers, or if I am extremely bored and don't have anything else to watch or listen to. And I should mention that I'm no stranger to musicality or music theory either. I played piano from elementary to high school, and picked up guitar and bass on the way too. And I will use those instruments to play those one-off songs, for me, until I reach the boredom point.

I'm not looking to ""fix"" this, I don't think it's a problem. I just would love to know how music fans react to this, and if you have any advice to try and get more enjoyment out of the art form. Right now I feel like it's a very practical relationship, but I know there is more fulfillment/enjoyment to be had.",0,1651592045

A few of my favorites from my playlist:

‚Ä¢ Oasis - Don‚Äôt Look Back in Anger
‚Ä¢ The Strokes - Why Are Sundays so Depressing
‚Ä¢ The Weeknd - Out of Time
‚Ä¢ Tame Impala - Eventually 
‚Ä¢ Tyler, the Creator - GONE GONE / THANK YOU
‚Ä¢ Ye - Ghost Town
‚Ä¢ Phoebe Bridgers - Motion Sickness

I would put songs like Beautiful by Eminem or Godspeed by Frank Ocean but I‚Äôm trying to stay away from overtly depressing songs. That being said, if you have any good moving on songs that are depressing then still send ‚Äòem my way lol.",0,1651588816

So, we‚Äôre more than likely going to be by far the youngest people there, I get that. My only concert going experience is seeing a Taylor Swift concert in college, and I can only imagine this is going to be a drastically different experience. None of the signs, costumes, or other such extravagance. Given it‚Äôs quite a ‚Äúclassy‚Äù venue from what I‚Äôve looked up online I plan on wearing something formal but hopefully not *too* formal (shirt and tie, no jacket) so is there anything else I should know?

This song has such a great groove to it. It's a blues in the key of E and you'll learn:

**-The main riff**

**-The Bo-Diddley style strumming pattern**

**-A classic blues turnaround**

Put these 3 things together and you too can start sounding like the blues greats we all love!

Music,uhc4hz,genuinelytho,1,my tears ricochet: Taylor Swift,"I really like the music ... it introduces you to the funeral setting and then the exposition lets you know that it's the speaker's funeral. Figuratively. 

The line, ""I didn't have it in myself to go with grace"" hits me so hard. I always interpreted in the way of wanting to walk out of a relationship without causing a scene. Quietly. Assuring the other person that 'its okay... we'll be fine. Just give it some' - when in reality, after a point you just want to punch the ceiling or yell on the call! Make them regret the way they treated you unintentionally. You know you can handle this like a mature person but you don't want to! Cause you can't! You need it to be over for you to start healing. But in that process, you ruin it beyond anybody's capability to recover it.


But now that I heard it again.... I interpreted it in a different way. How nice it would have been for the speaker to gracefully exit the relationship, with no sour feelings? Instead she died on her way out. 

Ending of a relationship is always difficult. It's like, a part of you dies along with it. And it sucks so much, when the person who killed you with their bare hands gets to yell, ""NO!!! WHAT HAPPENED?""

""WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?"" 

How can you be that oblivious? Could this be an act for the people around or for your own ""clean"" heart? Regardless, you can take off your angelic mask. 

For some reason, people just like pretending. They pretend to care while you're struggling, when they are the main reason behind it. And that's what this line symbolises, ""and you're the hero, flying around ... saving face"".


But my 2nd fav line has to be, ""&amp; I can go anywhere I want, anywhere I want... just not home"". 

It's so simple yet... magical. Maybe break-up was necessary. Sometimes things don't work out for whatever reason and you need to walk out before it can create you more damage... &amp; you are free to go anywhere. 

But then, with you I felt the most at home with. And now, I am homeless. Ahhhh. This song has been on repeat for past few days. It just hits me in feels.",0,1651569571

Firstly, I‚Äôd just like to hear some of you guys‚Äô recommendations for songs that I could listen to, to broaden my knowledge of how people have tried to fight back against dictatorships and war. 
I know some anti-war songs criticize wars, while others promote peace. And yet more satirize the whole thing.
And secondly, I was thinking of Pink Floyd‚Äôs recent release, ‚ÄúHey Hey, Rise Up‚Äù to support Ukraine. And wondering how much of a difference these songs actually make?

Music,uhb0zu,AzrielJohnson,1,Question About Older Underground Scenes,"I'm not sure how to phrase this question, please bear with me.

So, I know there's been an ""underground"" scene with music at least since the inception of Rock music. I'm curious about the lyrical content. In mainstream music in the 1900s, 1910s, 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, etc, the lyrics seemed pretty buttoned up and proper, no swearing and such.

I'm curious about bands/singers during these times that used profanity in their music. Are there any resources I could explore to find these kinds of bands? Profanity has always existed, right? So it stands to reason that profanity would exist in lyrics too.",0,1651564482

Newer hopsin, some logic, and vin jay). I‚Äôve grown to have better taste because a lot of lyrical rap I see as cringe. The lyrical rapper vs mumble rapper song by vin jay I don‚Äôt like because it‚Äôs generic, overdone, and cringe. And a lot of times newer Eminem sounds good but the lyrics are solely for rhyme scene and for that sometimes I can‚Äôt help but laugh because I can‚Äôt take it serious

I like lyrical rap cause I love how the change flows so much, and it‚Äôs just so pleasing to my ears and other rap doesn‚Äôt really do that for me the way lyrical rap does. I think I have a good understanding of what makes rap good because I make sure to say something in my lyrics. Even if my song doesn‚Äôt have a set theme I‚Äôll let a stream of thoughts happen and I‚Äôll go to one topic to the next but I never just rhyme to rhyme. I never go fast and just say random words ether, when I go fast my rhyme scheme is pretty basic but I stay on topic when I do so. And I never talk about being the ‚Äúgoat‚Äù or ‚Äúsavior of rap‚Äù but I present myself with confidence and say things in a more unique way. With all of this I think I have a good understanding of rap but I‚Äôm still scared to release stuff because of the rep lyrical rap gets, what do I do? Just release and say screw it? I don‚Äôt want to change my style to please others but I also don‚Äôt wanna be deemed a cornball before I even get a chance",0,1651561012

We take suggestions from listeners and explore all time periods, and genres. As this is meant to be a live event, there is an intro song inserted before the first album to ensure that all participants are synced up before the first album begins. There is also an intermission song inserted between the albums for anyone to take a break if required. We typically do 2 albums each night, but sometimes we sneak in a third. The point of the nights is not just to listen to great albums, but to hopefully find something new that shows you that there is great music in all genres.

Released: Oct 29 2021  
Suggested By: Bloodfistzero  
Genre: Death metal   
  
**Why?**	Brutally awesome  
**Do you think this is an album to hear before you die?** Yes  
**The best part of your day when you suggested this album:**  
  
  
**Ricinn - Lian:**  
Solo project of Laure Le Prunenec, singer from Igorrr and Corpo-Mente.  
  
Nearly all instrumentation, production, and imagery created by the artist herself.  
   
  
**Archspire - Bleed The Future:**  
Archspire originally went into the making of Bleed the Future under the idea they would complete the album between their tours in 2020. Of course, Covid-19 delayed the album prompting the band to do more pre-production work on the album. They subjected their creation to a near-constant critiquing that ensured they created their best album to date!

I think I'd like to start purchasing albums physically as well, but I'm not sure which direction to go. I don't own a record player and my CD player would be like my PS3 or something stupid (I'd likely buy an actual one.)

I'm not sure whether to go with CDs or vynels. I think vynels look better, but don't display very well on a shelf. While CDs display... better but still not that great. And I'm not sure what the sound quality is like for each case.

What are the pros/cons of CDs vs vynels? Are cheaper vynels worth anything?",0,1651547062

I'm honestly curious.... professional musicians/band, why do you make cover songs? I can't think of a single classic song that's been covered, where the cover is better than the original. I get you want to honor the song and show your appreciation but I think for the most part, no one wants to hear it unless you're whole deal is BEING a cover band. That's different. But artists with original work, who throw in a singular cover on their album.... yuk. 

I'm getting tired of my Spotify Discover Weekly being polluted with mediocre covers of great songs. I've actually submitted a request to Spotify to be able to filter covers and remixes haha. 

Anyway, every time I hear one, I think ""why???"" Usually if I explore the artist they have great originals but of course it's their shitty cover that's made it into my Discover Weekly. Nobody wants it! Leave Neil Diamond and other great artists alone! Unless you're Johnny Cash (R.I.P.). His cover songs are absolutely fantastic...",0,1651527825

Music,ugzz7f,AximiliTheAndalite,1,Songs that transport you to another world,"So, for context. I've read American Gods, and in it was a part about a man that was described as a dwarf (they never actually said he was a dwarf, just that he had the physical characteristics of one). He started humming in the car, a deep sound that reverberated through the windows, a sound that you could feel through the whole car.

Ever since I read that, I've been having this daydream of me sitting around a campfire with people, or auditioning for a play, or what have you, and singing like that. Starting out as a deep hum, maybe a few words even in between. One of those songs that when you close your eyes, it tells a story that you can see in your mind. You can close your eyes, see every detail of what the song is describing. One of those songs that when you open your eyes it feels like hours has passed, like you were literally in another world.

I know this is an unusual request, but I'm looking for songs like that. Ideally it would be only vocal. Words also aren't really required. I was thinking something like dwarf mining songs, but the results I found are too close to sea shanties. Think Misty Mountain Cold, except only vocals, deeper and maybe not even in English.

I hope I'm explaining this right. If I'm not, feel free to ask more in the comments.",0,1651526276
