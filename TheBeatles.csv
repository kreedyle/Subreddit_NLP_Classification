*Processing img hg5gvpzic6y81...*

I wanted to share with you all a project I recently released.

As I’m sure everyone else here did, I watched the 8-hour-long Get Back docuseries, and as a cover artist looking for his next big project, it got me very inspired. I put out an album in December that spanned everything from Aretha Franklin to John Mayer, and I wasn’t really sure where to go from there. I’ve always been a massive Beatles fan so it bummed me out that I hadn’t put out any Beatles covers yet, but as I was looking at the setlist of the rooftop concert, it hit me: “They only did 5 unique songs. That’s an EP right there.”

And now it is! After months of driving myself more than a little insane, “The Rooftop EP” is now available to stream and download (for free). Right here: [https://jacobsz.bandcamp.com/album/the-rooftop-ep](https://jacobsz.bandcamp.com/album/the-rooftop-ep)

This was an interesting endeavor. Since I was paying homage to a live concert, I wanted to allow room for improvisation and imperfections, but at the same time… it’s The Beatles. And for 3 of the 5 songs, the rooftop version is the version. Even though not all of the songs are super famous, I wanted to make something that appealed to Beatles fans like me who know the deeper cuts just as well as the more ‘mainstream’ tracks.

Because of this weird paradox, it made the most sense for me to do this as a one-man band project. Operating at such a specific level of discretion – “this drum fill definitely needs to be copied note-for-note”, “just get the chords and general strumming pattern for this rhythm guitar part” – makes it hard for anyone who isn’t literally inside my head to jump on-board. So I did everything: John, Paul, and occasionally George’s vocals; John and George’s guitars; Paul’s bass; Ringo’s drums; and Billy’s electric piano.

Full transparency here: While the goal was to imitate a live show, almost nothing is truly one take. I recorded the parts in complete run-throughs, generally 2 to 4 takes each, and spliced the best bits together. The piano was the only thing not done this way. I’m simply not a proficient enough keyboardist, but I had a MIDI controller and a vision.

I’ll be releasing a video version soon, and hopefully some behind-the-scenes clips as well, but in the meantime, please enjoy “The Rooftop EP”!",0,1651982106

   * Composed by Paul, with some help from John on the lyrics.  
   * Allegedly, the opening lyrics were originally ""She was just seventeen / never been a beauty queen"", with John reacting by saying ""You're joking about that line, aren't you?""
   * Paul has since said that his bass line in this song is pretty much a carbon copy of the bass in Chuck Berry's [I'm Talking About You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbLRHpc5IKQ).
* [I'm A Loser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f70Z3cvrQd0)
   * Lennon composition and vocal
   * Certainly a start of the introspective lyrics vs the happy-go-lucky-young-love lyrics.
   * Somewhat inspired by the early folk period of Bob Dylan and country music: the fingerpicking, the twang, John's descending vocal lines, etc.
   * Also released as a B-side to their cover of Chuck Berry's Rock and Roll Music

I am going to see Paul next month in Winston-Salem, and I was wondering…

George: 69-70
Ringo: 73

Disclaimer: This is not meant to diminish any of their work in the past of their careers nor say they didn't get better with time. This is just a discussion about our personal thoughts about their peak moments. 

My favorite Lennon record is Mind Games and if I had to choose a favorite McCartney album I'd go with Flowers In The Dirt. But IMHO Paul's voice in Abbey Road, Let It Be and McCartney is near godly.

   * The story I've seen is that the group was asked to write a song for Helen Shapiro (then a young and successful singer), but her manager rejected the song. Another young singer, Kenny Lynch, recorded it and it became the first Beatles song to be covered by another artist in 1963.
   * The version recorded for and released on Please Please Me came out at roughly the same time as Lynch's version.
* [Her Majesty](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Mh1hKt5kQ_4)
   * A quick sketch of a song written and played by Paul
   * Was intended to be between Mean Mr. Mustard and Polythene Pam in the Abbey Road medley, but was cut out of it.  The chord that opens the track is actually the ending chord of Mean Mr. Mustard's recording, with the ending note intending to lead into the opening chords of Polythene Pam.
   * One of the earliest examples of a ""hidden track"".

*  [Don't Bother Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k03IQbaTcxc)
   * George Harrison's debut composition (as far as the album chronology is concerned)
   * Naturally, it's also a George lead vocal
* [I Want To Tell You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kXusIyqQ2o)
   * George had three songs on Revolver: Taxman, Love You To and this.
   * Definitely a fun song to pick apart in terms of its construction. It's offbeat and eastern in very subtle sorts of ways.

TheBeatles,toi2g9,exileondaytonst,1,The Differences Between Let It Be and Let It Be,"If this topic's been covered in another post, let me know, but all I've seen are questions and polls asking people which version they like better.

I thought I'd try to make an attempt at detailing the differences between these (it's more than the tone of the solo), but first some recording details:

* Somewhat famously written from a reassuring dream Paul had of his (long since passed away) mother during the turmoil of the White Album sessions.  Paul's said in interviews that people may think of it as referring to the biblical Mary if they choose, and the lyric is open enough for such an interpretation.
* Paul fiddled with it during the White Album sessions, and revisited it at the Twickenham ""Get Back"" sessions, but it was never recorded as a group until the band regrouped at Apple Studios shortly after Twickenham
* The majority of each version comes from three different takes of the song from the Apple Studios recordings:
   * Take 1 (from 25 Jan 1969) - The first full band take of the recording.  Paul on piano and lead vocal, George on guitar and backing vocal, John on bass and backing vocal, Ringo on drums.
      * Billy Preston had arrived at the sessions well before this point, but if his Hammond Organ is in this take, you can barely hear it.
      * George's guitar has a very clean tone to it.
      * Paul is still working through the lyrics at this point:  The third verse is just a repeat of the first, and the final chorus doesn't feature the phrase ""there will be an answer"", instead repeating ""whisper words of wisdom"".  Paul's vocal inflections (emphasis on the elongated 'e' in ""Be"" during the chorus, specifically) change in each performance, but this is the most unique take on that front.  He also repeats the title of the track during the outro in this take.
   * Takes 27A and 27B (from 31 Jan 1969) - Same personnel as Take 1, but with a very noticeable change in how much of Billy Preston's Hammond Organ exists on the tracks.
      * George's guitar is played through a Leslie speaker to get the oscillating effect (I'm unsure if he further uses any sort of chorus effect to get the particular tone he has here).
      * John is noted to have played a 6-string bass on these takes.  He very well may have played the same bass in Take 1, but I'm not positive.
      * Take 27A became the master track for each version of the song, although elements of 27B were mixed in on the Naked version.
      * There's something peculiar in the final Am chord during the final verse (over the word ""mother"") in Paul's piano track from this take, and it's notable in the Single and Album versions that use this track.  I don't have the ear to pick out what the difference is from listening to it (I'll defer to people with a better knowledge of scales and a better ear for pitch recognition), but knowing that it's there I hear it where I hear a more natural A minor chord in other takes.  
* Overdubs that were later recorded include:
   * On 30 April 1969, George overdubbed a new version of the solo, using the same Leslie speaker and effect as in takes 27A and 27B.
   * Orchestral accompaniment (predominantly brass, but also strings) was arranged by George Martin and recorded in early January 1970 with Martin and Paul supervising the session players.
   * Around the same time, George overdubbed another new version of the solo, this time with a distorted effect and a different attack on the strings (less focused on bending notes, more hammering on and percussive picking).  This overdub also features some riffing during the final chorus.
   * Also around the same time, George Martin recorded a new track of backing vocals featuring Paul, George, and Linda McCartney
   * Somewhere along this process, Paul recorded a new bass track to replace John's.

Now, for the actual released versions of the songs:

* [Single Version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atLK2RIZzWk)
   * Mixed from Take 27A.
   * Uses the April 1969 overdub of George's solo.  The original solo from Take 27A is reduced to a point that it's only (faintly) audible from bleeding over into the drum, piano, and vocal tracks.  George's soloing during the final chorus is dialed back considerably in the mix.
* [Album Version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYfEBY9NM4)
   * Remixed/produced by Phil Spector instead of George Martin
   * Also uses Take 27A, and the January 1970 version of George's guitar solo (with the 27A solo eliminated similar to the Single version).  George's soloing during the final chorus is very prominent.
   * Spector reduces the backing vocals, and makes the orchestra more prominent in the mix.  He also adds a tape delay effect to Ringo's hi-hat
   * The final chorus features three run-throughs of the ""Let It Be"" lines (ending in ""There will be an answer"" twice, then ""Whisper words of wisdom"" once, compared to the two run-throughs with one ""there will be an answer"" and one ""whisper words of wisdom"" heard in the single and Naked versions)..
* [Anthology Version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjnSFh2s644)
   * It's pretty much just Take 1.  No overdubs, aside from some spliced-in dialogue from the recording sessions.
* [Naked Version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcA-qlMP11s)
   * Also mixed from Take 27A (primarily)
   * The guitar solo from Take 27B is used instead of any of the overdubs
   * Paul's piano part is overdubbed (from when I'm not sure, or it's taken from the 27B recording) and is slightly different, featuring an added A bass note to the Am chord in the intro, and doesn't feature whatever is going on in the Am chord over the last verse.
   * The orchestral arrangement is excised completely, as well as all of Phil Spector's additions/effects.
   * Billy's organ part is brought more into the forefront of the mix, particularly in the second verse.

TheBeatles,tg2f1v,Routine_Soft_8766,1,Did Paul McCartney write the love song ‘I Will’ for Beatles secretary Freda Kelly?,"  I watched the ‘Good Ol Freda’ documentary and couldn’t help but wonder which of the Beatles Freda Kelly may have been romantically involved with. 

  She declines to answer when asked if she’d dated any of them, but her smirk speaks for itself lol! Given the ‘free love’ scene of the 60s, it’s not to hard to believe she would’ve been involved with at least one of the band members *wink*

  During the film, we find out she was extremely close to both Ringo and Paul’s families. A newspaper went as far as to print a story that Paul and Freda were engaged, but was later retracted.

  What lead me to question if Paul had penned the beautiful love song for her was a Q&amp;A video with Freda and Ryan White, the director of the documentary. He spoke about the Beatles songs they use in the film. Four in total. ‘Love Me Do’, ‘I Saw Her Standing There’, ‘I Feel Fine’ and ‘I Will’. He then suggests that one of the four was written for Freda. Of course, she bashfully tries to deny it.

I can see the connection between each tune and the relationship that may have developed between the members and the devoted fan turned secretary. But the fact that ‘I Will’ is very different from the other songs and also played during the ending credits struck me as an “Ode to Freda” moment.

  Also the fact that the song was written during the Beatles time in India in 1968. Coincidentally, Freda was married while they were away. Was this Paul’s goodbye?

  We also see a quick glimpse of a message Paul writes to Freda in her autograph book. He refers to her as “The Love Of My Life”. 

  Maybe I’ve gone down the rabbit hole, but it doesn’t seem too far fetched. Especially given Paul’s reputation as a ladies man. There are more subtle hints throughout the documentary, but check it out for yourselves. If you’ve seen it, what do you think?",0,1647493235

   * The Rolling Stones released the song first [as their own single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn0fHHGKRZU) before the Beatles released their own version on With The Beatles... definitely some differences in the instrumentation and style there.

TheBeatles,taowkd,cooliofoolio707,1,Early Beatles Modernized album covers (no record label logos),"I was tired of the cluttered look of having all the record label logos and stuff on the early Beatles album covers. I edited all of them out/ looked for original sources for remastering/did some touching up. I hope people enjoy and don't get too mad about me altering history ;)    
If these early albums get remixed, this is what I imagine the covers may look like (influenced partly by the similarly logo-less MFSL releases)  


The edits get less and less complex as the discography goes to revolver, after revolver there is no need to edit as the covers become modern. (No label logos or mono/stereo denotation)

I didn't do Beatles For Sale yet but I plan on doing it in the future. I think the edit for it would be relatively simple.

It was like the World Wildlife Fund version, but pitched down, like the original. I can't remember if it had the high pitched ""Nothing's gonna change my world"" but it definitely had the ""ahh's"" after that. I've been looking for it since a long time and I can't find it. The most similar I found was the Glyn Johns mix but just because it's the WWF version... Without the ""ahh's"".

Interestingly, he recorded a version with his own group a few years after leaving the Beatles, with himself on lead vocals. 

Stu Sutcliffe - was the Beatles’ bassist for a little over a year. He also most notably sang Love Me Tender as his solo vocal spot, which was a huge hit with live audiences, although sadly no recordings exist of him performing it.

   * Of course, people over the years have assumed Yoko was the monkey (or perhaps heroin) regardless of how true that actually is
* [I'll Be Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJSTBNTac6k)
   * Recorded for (and closing off side 2 of) the soundtrack to A Hard Day's Night.
   * Unlike The Terminator's catch phrase, ""I'll Be Back"" did not appear on film.
   * A John composition and lead vocal
   * Some historians have said it's based on the chordal structure of [Del Shannon's Runaway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaHgHrCwQBA).  Which is certainly in the realm of influences for the band, but... I dunno

TheBeatles,sxun6r,Alex72598,1,Do you believe John’s story about the writing of Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds?,"Per Wikipedia: “John Lennon said that his inspiration for the song came when his three-year-old son Julian showed him a nursery school drawing that he called ""Lucy – in the Sky with Diamonds"", depicting his classmate Lucy O'Donnell. Julian later recalled: ""I don't know why I called it that or why it stood out from all my other drawings, but I obviously had an affection for Lucy at that age. I used to show Dad everything I'd built or painted at school, and this one sparked off the idea."" Ringo Starr witnessed the moment and said that Julian first uttered the song's title on returning home from nursery school. Lennon later said, ""I thought that's beautiful. I immediately wrote a song about it.""

According to Lennon, the lyrics were largely derived from the literary style of Lewis Carroll's novel Alice in Wonderland.Lennon had read and admired Carroll's works, and the title of Julian's drawing reminded him of the ""Which Dreamed It?"" chapter of Through the Looking Glass, in which Alice floats in a ""boat beneath a sunny sky"". Lennon recalled in a 1980 interview:

“It was Alice in the boat. She is buying an egg and it turns into Humpty-Dumpty. The woman serving in the shop turns into a sheep and the next minute they are rowing in a rowing boat somewhere and I was visualizing that.” 

——————————————————————-

For what it’s worth, Paul also backed up John’s story about the lyrics being inspired by Alice In Wonderland: 

“Paul McCartney remembered of the song's composition, ""We did the whole thing like an Alice in Wonderland idea, being in a boat on the river ... Every so often it broke off and you saw Lucy in the sky with diamonds all over the sky. This Lucy was God, the Big Figure, the White Rabbit."" He later recalled helping Lennon finish the song at Lennon's Kenwood home, specifically claiming he contributed the ""newspaper taxis"" and ""cellophane flowers"" lyrics.”

——————————————————————-

Now me, I used to be one of those who thought it was obviously about LSD, but knowing how much John loved Lewis Carroll’s work and often took inspiration from it, plus the fact that everyone more of less seems to agree with this account, I really don’t see any reason to doubt his version of events. 

At the end of the day, it’s all just for fun. The song is very trippy either way, it’s just interesting that out of all their songs, this is the one who’s origin story is doubted the most. So I was just curious about what you guys think.

TheBeatles,sxatyu,zeno0771,1,Just finished watching Get Back last night. What a ride.,"Context:  I'm a Gen-Xer with bonafide Boomer parents (mom even went to Woodstock).  They were my gateway to at least 50% of the music I listen to even today because I was listening to it with them when it was still new/recent.  Years back, PBS would air The Compleat Beatles and after John was killed watching it became a yearly ritual in our house.  Even before Get Back it seems to have been left in the dust as much of the band's historical blanks have been filled in over the last 40 years.  It was as concise as a documentary about them at that time could be however, hitting all the highlights and lowlights and while it didn't convey nearly the detail and emotion that a sprawling Peter Jackson epic is capable of, you came away from it with enough knowledge that had you not known about them before, you could hold your own in a conversation with a fan.

Get Back isn't just ""a longer Beatles documentary""; it's certainly longer but, rather than being all-encompassing it'ss focused on one specific series of events leading to a historical moment (I'd say it was a pivotal point in the band's existence but really, weren't they all?)  And yet, it made me feel like everything I knew about them was...not wrong, necessarily, but misunderstood.  

The Compleat Beatles left me with the impression that John, Paul, and George didn't want anything to do with each other for the next decade after they broke up and while there may have been times when that was the case, it was not exactly the rule and certainly not gospel.  These guys didn't hate each other; they were just tired of being The Beatles.  The rooftop performance wasn't the spontaneous stress-relieving exercise that casual lore describes it as but rather the rushed realization of a project that none of them really wanted to do.  John wasn't a tweeky belligerent jerk; I mean yes, he *was* still John, but the first thing that surprised me was how happy he'd seemed in spite--or perhaps because--of it basically being the end of the band.  I should note here that one of my lifelong fears is that of getting into an argument with a Liverpudlian because I'd never be able to tell if I pissed them off until it was too late.  With that in mind, I submit that I may have missed something in their discussions, but I doubt it considering nothing non-verbal could have escaped the cameras here:  When someone was zoomed-in on, you weren't just looking at a large face, you were *in their face* and I admit it got uncomfortable at times. I felt like I was a hanger-on, not a fly on the wall but one on the mic.  John and Paul weren't just making excuses about the project when saying they were tired; you can see it in their faces as if they never said a word.  Everyone knows the ""George got the shaft"" part of the Beatles' story, but you witness it in real time here.  That wasn't just disappointment in his face, he was genuinely hurt, and John did seem genuinely contrite when George came back.

The dynamic of leadership--or lack thereof--that resulted from the loss of Brian Epstein is very much front-and-center here.  No one knows if they should make decisions with themselves in mind or in a band context.  George Martin doesn't seem at this point to be much more than an executive minder with Glyn Johns going above &amp; beyond in his job as engineer.  A lot of people are telling them what to do here but no one is *managing*, and Allen Klein smelled blood in the water.  John wanted to be in charge of John and that would have been true even without Yoko whispering in his ear.  George just wanted to be heard.  Ringo just wanted to get along and play some damn music.  So with everyone's divergent, and sometimes conflicting, viewpoints, Paul seemed to have said ""Right, no one else will do it so why shouldn't I?""  John calls him on it, saying in effect ""you can have the job because I don't want it, but don't forget I'm still here, and *we* made this thing"".  

Again, witnessing it happening changes perspective but Yoko doesn't actually seem here like the universally-despised ""bad influence"" history has portrayed her as (and to be fair she hasn't done much since then to downplay that image).  If anything it's Paul who seems more easily-distracted.  The one part where lore and history agree is the rooftop performance itself:  This was the first time in years that they were able to play a live show with an audience and be able to hear themselves (though doing too good a job at that as far as local law-enforcement was concerned).  Those smiles were genuine.  They were doing what they loved and missed doing.  In fact there were numerous times throughout this when I had to remind myself that this wasn't a biopic or recreation.  These aren't actors overdoing rehearsed accents or interpreting history differently; yes that's really George Martin and Glyn Johns and yes Michael Lindsay-Hogg really did look like he was 16 years old and no, there was no wardrobe department playing up some contrived historical authenticity by giving them those fur coats.  This was...it.  This is what happened.  By the time in Part 2 when they first suggest playing on the roof, it was like watching band rehearsals on the Titanic:  You knew in a historical sense what would ultimately happen, but it was still some heavy foreshadowing.

There was a period of Beatles market-saturation for a time before George's death in 2001.  Sean Ono Lennon, Dhani Harrison, Zak Starkey, and James McCartney all seem content to do their own thing (with Harrison's output being the closest to his father's than any of the others).  Last week I caught myself singing the chorus to ""Two Of Us"" in the truck (yes, on my way home) and for maybe 30 seconds it occurred to me that I couldn't place the song.  Another testament to the otherworldly ability of the Lennon-McCartney force-of-nature to write a hook that gets you before you even realize you're singing.  When I heard this movie was being made I was initially dismissive of it as being just another repackaging by a director with equal amounts of money, hubris, and spare time.  I'm glad I was wrong and the experience was--with apologies for sounding melodramatic--life-changing.",1,1645389670

TheBeatles,suu08j,Alex72598,1,Favorite album opener? (Please Please Me to Rubber Soul),"I Saw Her Standing There - an early Lennon / McCartney composition, mainly written by Paul. The first of George Martin’s “potboilers”, this one gets the Beatles’ debut started off in rocking fashion with excited vocals and shouting and George’s first great solo. 

It Won’t Be Long - A mainly John Lennon song, and yet another potboiler style song, featuring a fast rhythm, very energetic yeahs (over 50 of them, I believe!), a soulful double tracked vocal from John, and some of their most intricate harmonies in the bridge, as well as possibly the most beautiful ending of any Beatles song. 

A Hard Day’s Night - Title track of the album and movie, mainly written by John, maybe the one song that to most people would sum up their moptop era. It features another strong vocal performance from John, a switch up to Paul in the bridge, more sweet harmonies, a classic driving Ringo backbeat, and some truly dreamy lead guitar work from George. 

No Reply - An acoustic based number primarily written by John that features some of his most melancholy lyrics to date, incredible harmonizing between he and Paul, particularly in the bridge, and sets the tone for the rest of the Beatles For Sale album as a more downbeat, acoustic based record. Despite this, it is still a very energetic track, which is likely why it was placed first on the album.  

Help! - Once again, this primarily John composed title track of the album and film is placed first, and it has all the “potboiler” sensibilities and tight harmonizing we’ve come to expect from opening tracks on Beatles albums and ending on another dreamy harmonized “ooh”, not unlike some of its predecessors. This song features some very unique harmony arrangements that perfectly complement and weave in and out through John’s lead vocal. 

Drive My Car - This song, primarily written by Paul, continues to embrace the upbeat tempo and sound of album openers in spite of the melancholy nature of Rubber Soul overall. Featured here is another interesting harmony arrangement as technically John and Paul are singing the entire song as a duet, though Paul’s voice is much more prominent in the verses, while John’s (along with George’s) becomes more noticeable in the choruses and the “beep beep, yeah!” refrains. 

My personal favorite is “It Won’t Be Long”, I think it sets the stage perfectly and encapsulates all the enthusiastic energy and talent of the early Beatles. But honestly I like them all.

TheBeatles,sukqck,Jason_Phox,1,A question about Beatles guitars,"My current goal when listening to The Beatles is to be able to say

""ok - that's Ringo""

or

""that's George""

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just being a bit OCD regarding with that at present. I really want to know who is playing what at any given point in time.

&amp;#x200B;

With bass and drums it is relatively straightforward.

But with guitars, not so.

&amp;#x200B;

My understanding of guitar playing may be incorrect.

Here is what I think:

When the guitarist is strumming, that is referred to as the ""rhythm guitar section"".

And when the guitarist is playing some melody (by plucking the as opposed to strumming, that is referred to as the ""lead guitar section"".

&amp;#x200B;

I have 2 questions:

&amp;#x200B;

(I am not a guitarist, so please pardon my ignorance).

1) Am I correct in assuming that any lead guitar part in a Beatles song is (generally) played by George?

&amp;#x200B;

2) How can I tell when John is playing?

Is it always the strumming sections?

&amp;#x200B;

Because I assume that George could also potentially by strumming.

&amp;#x200B;

My understanding is that a guitarist plays either the rhythm or the lead.

And I believe George played the lead (mostly) with the Beatles.

And John played rhythm guitar,

&amp;#x200B;

So how do I know when John is playing?

&amp;#x200B;

Is there perhaps an example of a part in a song that clearly identifies John's guitar playing?",6,1645089807

I also don’t think it fits in with the overall sound of Help. I personally feel like it should have been released as a single. The Beatles did have a few other songs written around this time which could’ve been included on the album instead. 

Wait - was written early enough, it was rejected at the time and eventually included on Rubber Soul. 

Yes It Is - was the B side to Ticket To Ride, which did make the album. 

I’m Down - was included as the B side to Help! when it was released as a single. 

Bad Boy - cover of a Larry Williams song, like Dizzy Miss Lizzie (maybe having two on one album would’ve been too much? Still a great track though)

I think any of these songs would’ve been better since they actually involved the entire group, though my vote would go to Yes It Is personally. 

So which song do you think should be on the album?

Originally intend as a throwback to the band’s early days of live, in-studio recording in order to boost their diminishing morale and comradery, The Beatles set out to rehearse and record an album’s worth of material without overdubs, concluding with an actual live performance and a television special documenting the process.  Unfortunately the end result, compiled twice by Glyn Johns, was simply too rough and sloppy to be release-worthy and was shelved.  Phil Spector was later appointed to make an album out of the tapes in 1970 and, even though better performances were selected, Spector infamously added his own orchestration, going against the live “warts and all” concept of the *Get Back* album.  This reconstruction attempts to offer what a fully-realized *Get Back* album would have sounded like if it had been properly completed in April 1969.    This  reconstruct features a number of custom, unique edits, most notably a  full-band Beatles studio take of ""All Things Must Pass"".  As a bonus disc, **I am including my own personal lossless rip of the streaming only Apple Rooftop Performance.**""",1,1644534927

Bad To Me, I’m In Love, From A Window, World Without Love. Alternatively, they could’ve made a go at No Reply, which was written early enough that it could’ve been added at the last minute. Finally, there was a song George had written called “You Know What To Do”, which appears on the anthology. It’s very sparse, but there was definitely room to fill it out, I think it had potential.

Personally my vote goes to Bad To Me, and No Reply, as amazing as it is, in my opinion works better as the opener for Beatles For Sale, but the others all would have been great choices too.

TheBeatles,slw1mr,josbee,1,Beatles Concept Albums (Based on Solo Albums - Streaming Links Included),"Hello everyone! New member to the subreddit but long time Beatles fan. 

I have recently started a project in which I am listening to every Beatles member solo albums in order post breakup and creating “beatle-y” type albums based on their solo songs. Each album has a concept and are all songs from just about the same time period. If you are a big beatles fan but not too well versed in all of the great solo albums, this is a great introduction. Also if you know all of them, great way to mix and match them. 

I will continue sharing them as I listen to all 70+ of the solo albums. Consider it a passion project I’d like to share with all Beatles fans who want to know more about the band after the breakup. 

Each Album/Playlist has a link to a corresponding music streaming service. (Apple Music, Tidal, and Spotify). 

Please let me know what you think! 

Peace and Love! #beatles

Album #1: This Plastic Beatles Journey Must Pass 

This first album title is simply a mix of all the first solo albums POST breakup. (John’s Plastic Ono Band, Ringo’s Sentimental Journey, George’s All Things Must Pass). I decided to use the word “Beatles” instead of album name “McCartney” in the album title because Paul was the one Beatle wanting to keep the band alive and kicking the most during Get Back. This album really reflects each band member trying to find their own niche. 

Some of my favorite parts include the piano transition from Paul’s Maybe I’m Amazed going into John’s Isolation track and George kicks off the album with one of the most beautiful songs as he’s the one with the most to prove post breakup. Ringo pops in with one very good track (Stardust) from Sentimental Journey arranged by Paul McCartney.

Album #2: Her Majesty Vol. 2

Solo albums used: Plastic Ono Band, RAM, Beaucoups of Blues, ATMP.  

This album is a banger and make sure you listen to this one as loud as you can. It starts off very mellow, George sneaks in an all timer with “My Sweet Lord”. Once Ringo’s “Silent Homecoming” fades out, the amps start to hit overdrive. 

If you have crosfade on, this next section consists of four straight songs of pure rock and roll. They kind of tell a story too. Monkberry Moon Delight comes on and John responds with “I Found Out”. Paul comes back and tells John to stop preaching with “Too Many People” and George steps up and hits them both with “Wah-Wah”. After that cooler heads prevail and it eases back with “Oh Yoko!” and continues the mellow theme but with some powerful songs. There is tension but these are still the Beatles, the four best rock and rollers of all time. Paul closes it out with “Smile Away”.

Album #3: God Save The Beatles

Solo Albums used: Wild Life (Paul), ATMP, Beaucoups of Blues, Imagine (John) 

This album highlights a lot of the mistrust between the band. George kicks it off with “Isn’t it a Pity?” and the tension created from the last album returns. 

John calls out Paul in “How do you Sleep” (great guitar and vocals from John) and Paul tries to make amends with Dear Friend. John hits back with one of my favorite songs “How?”. 

Paul reassures him with “I am your Singer” BUT HE BRINGS IN LINDA! John hits back again with “Gimme some truth” and George warns everyone to “Beware of Darkness”. There’s a false sense of hope that follows in the next couple of songs and Ringo ends the album reminding us that “Love Don’t Last Long”. (Sorry that was a lot but this was the thinking behind the album concept of “God Save The Beatles”)

This album really highlights Ringo as the glue that keeps the Beatles alive. Ringo’s album features every single Beatles member at one point or another. John writes I’m the Greatest, George helps write “Photograph”, Ringo calls up Paul to collaborate as well and he writes Six O’Clock and features on backup vocals, and George and MAL EVANS — flashbacks of Mal hitting the anvil during Get Back — write You and Me (Babe). 

I love how Ringo ends the album in a “Good Night-esque” ending and thanks all the members of the Beatles for featuring in the album. During the making of Ringo (1973), there were plenty of rumors swirling of The Beatles getting back together, but we know now that was not the case. 

I call this one Royal Relapse because it just feels like this is the beginning of the reunion and the songs by all four feel like it too. My personal favorite is George’s “Deep Blue” (I may be 100% wrong but when I listen to this song I can’t help but hearing the chords from “For You Blue” from the Let it Be album. It’s almost like it’s George saying “I’m still that guy from back then”). It’s a Side A because I want to make a sick B side to it.

The 2015 Remaster in the “1” compilation album sounds really good. I’ve never liked Phil Spector’s “wall of sound” technique, but I can appreciate if a song has a clear and distinct orchestra as a main part of the instrumentation. 

To me, this song doesn’t sound washed up, but more like a calming, softly sung piano ballad with a really pretty orchestral backing. I also think this song is a rare example of Paul getting vulnerable in his lyrics, I personally find them really poetic and I relate to them. I’m a listener who loves change-ups, and songs that are different from one another. I am not a listener who needs a consistent sound for every song in a band. So even though TLAWR doesn’t sound like a Beatles song, to me the final product was an honest, bittersweet and artistic expression of the difficult emotions Paul may have been going through during the final Beatles years.",0,1643677557

* [Every Beatles album track, non-album single, and b-side ranked](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQBVqFAl-01Q-WShPrExAM-BI-2oJAJB1H_d1cTqHh9u0tPdbExJmsPDPyRgvHA4_2_Ss_q5gdg-Pch/pubhtml?gid=53960212&amp;single=true)
* [A graphical ranking of every Beatles album (UK/core catalog), as well as the Singles and B-Sides (each separated into 1963-1965 and 1966-1970 eras)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQBVqFAl-01Q-WShPrExAM-BI-2oJAJB1H_d1cTqHh9u0tPdbExJmsPDPyRgvHA4_2_Ss_q5gdg-Pch/pubchart?oid=562992356&amp;format=interactive)

.... and then let me comment (a lot)

So... what is this?

* It's an ongoing project, an attempt to (as objectively as possible) rank the entire Beatles catalog.  Both for the individual songs, and for the albums as a whole.

And how exactly do you plan on doing that?

* The TL;DR version is this:  I'm tracking the results of opinion polls on /r/TheBeatles (and the one tournament I could find from /r/Beatles, which otherwise doesn't have polls).
* Using a spreadsheet and some matrix math, I use the results of those polls to rank the songs and albums

No, seriously, how are you doing this?

* Every poll has a result, and so it can be tracked (what I've been able to find is logged [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQBVqFAl-01Q-WShPrExAM-BI-2oJAJB1H_d1cTqHh9u0tPdbExJmsPDPyRgvHA4_2_Ss_q5gdg-Pch/pubhtml?gid=743270179&amp;single=true))
* From that list of polls and results, I can make matrices of the songs that have polled against each other, and their cumulative results.
* I can do the same whenever albums poll against each other (ex:  if there's a Drive My Car vs Something poll, that is also a poll between Rubber Soul and Abbey Road, and I can track accordingly)
* My mathematical model is based on the Bradley Terry Model, specifically a version of it called ""KRACH"" that is used (in an unofficial capacity) by people who follow college hockey in the US.  Some details (including some of the math involved) on the KRACH methodology are found [here](https://www.collegehockeynews.com/info/?d=krach) and [here](http://elynah.com/tbrw/tbrw.cgi?krach).
   * I like this rating system primarily because it accounts for the ""strength of schedule"" (how good the matchup opponents are) without introducing any subjective weighting factors.
   * My only major deviation from this methodology is that I don't treat ""wins"" and ""losses"" as binary.  Instead of giving the winner of a poll a score of 1, and the loser a 0, I use the % of a poll result.  This way, the margin of victory in a poll is reflected in the ratings.
   * Ex: [A Day In The Life beats I Am The Walrus 55-20](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBeatles/comments/ksmhle/song_battle_1_a_day_in_the_life_vs_i_am_the_walrus/) in a poll.  ADITL gets .7333 points, IATW gets .2667 points.  For inter-album purposes, Sgt Peppers (the album) also gets .7333 points, and Magical Mystery Tour (the album) gets .2667 points.
* The rating value itself represents a ratio of ""votes for"" over ""votes against"" for the song (or album) if we did a full round-robin of every single song (or album) in the discography.
   * There's a trick I used to ""normalize"" the ratings (described in one of the KRACH links above) to make sure that this is what the rating value represents (it would otherwise just average out to something else)
   * A rating of 1 would theoretically be an average song/album that would win one vote for every vote it lost if we were to poll it against every other song/album.
   * A rating of 2 would be a song/album that gets 2 votes for each vote against (correlating to 0.667 if you thought of that as a ""win percentage"")
   * A rating of 0.5 would be a song/album that gets 2 votes against for every vote for, etc. (correlating to a 0.333 ""win percentage"")

Okay... but these initial results look weird to me.   What's up with that?

* Well, for one, expect this to change and evolve as more poll data is gathered.
* There are probably three reasons for people thinking that when they see the rankings:
   * [This reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWdd6_ZxX8c)
   * We don't have a lot of data right now, and the data that we do have is skewed towards judging albums by the hits and not by their depth.
      * For example:  as of me writing this, Please Please Me has polled against the other albums 42 times.  Polls for either I Saw Her Standing There or Twist And Shout going against songs from other albums account for 29 of those matchups.  And 10 of the songs on that record haven't polled against any songs that aren't on that record.  Ergo, the ""results"" for PPM are highly skewed towards how people feel about ISHST and TAS, not how people feel about the album as a whole.
      * This is a large reason why I've been posting so many ""random"" polls (featuring a lot of deep cuts and b-sides) in the sub, to help round out the polling data.  These polls aren't actually random, I'm using my spreadsheet to identify (a) songs that haven't been polled much, and (b) songs that haven't been polled much from albums that haven't polled against each other very often.
   * But also... there are a LOT of polls on this sub that aren't head-to-head matchups.  In fact, most polls on this sub are 3-, 4-, 5-, or 6-way polls.  I can still use those polls, but it's an open question how ""true"" the results are compared to a head to head poll.
      * Ex:  [This time](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBeatles/comments/s7xdgl/choose_your_favorite_song_in_the_group/) where Taxman, Eleanor Rigby and Love You To all went against each other, and the votes went 66, 117, and 9 (respectively).
      * I can say that Taxman beat LYT 66-9 (those are the votes that absolutely preferred those songs over the others).  But what about those 117 Eleanor Rigby voters? How would they have voted if ER wasn't an option?  Tough to say.
      * Plus, if I count all combinations of those poll results, I have one poll that counts twice for each song.
      * This spoiler effect (and the 5 poll results per song if it's a single 6-song poll) gets worse when you have  more polling options.
      * As a result, I've tracked results from lots of multi-song polls since it's mostly what I find on this sub, but I'm only tracking the ""final"" results from all the Survivor polls I've found here.
      * If there were more head-to-head data out there, I'd feel perfectly fine deleting all of the 3+ song polls from my data set.  But that accounts for a VAST majority of my data, so I don't want to... yet.
      * I could also resolve the issue slightly by introducing a weighting system to limit the impact of multi-song polls, but then I'm introducing subjectivity into my equations in a way that I don't like.

What about songs that aren't on here?

* So far, my list of songs and notes about them is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQBVqFAl-01Q-WShPrExAM-BI-2oJAJB1H_d1cTqHh9u0tPdbExJmsPDPyRgvHA4_2_Ss_q5gdg-Pch/pubhtml?gid=742198352&amp;single=true).
   * Since have columns for who wrote it, and who sang lead and what year they were released, I could probably compare/rank songwriters and lead vocalists and years in the catalog, too.
* George Martin's score on the b-side of Yellow Submarine isn't included and two of the songs there were previously released, so there's only 4 songs from that ""album"" represented
* It gets a little confusing when there's more than one version of a song out there:
   * I figure if the song is of a demo quality or otherwise the arrangement isn't different (such as:  the German-language versions of She Loves You and I Want To Hold Your Hand, or almost all of the Anthology collections), it doesn't warrant tracking them separately
   * If the arrangement is significantly different, I think it makes sense to track them separately:  Revolution vs Revolution 1 vs Revolution 9, for instance.  Or the two versions of Let It Be (single vs album).
   * I'm not yet tracking the original vs ""naked"" Long And Winding Road, but I'm thinking I should (not too many other ""naked"" tracks are suuuuuuper different).  I could add that, plus Free As A Bird and Real Love as a ""Post-1970 Songs"" category?  Not sure what else there would be that's worth tracking.

This seems silly and absurd.

* Yeah, sure, I probably can't argue against that.  Still, though...  [¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izeYZqxDAm8)",1,1643656267

TheBeatles,sh6omk,Lumpy_Reserve_4852,1,John And Paul.....which one!?!?!?,I’m in the mood for a debate about the two major songwriters in the Beatles. First off I’m gonna say that I absolutely love them both. Equally though?  I had a very very had time answering this question for YEARs!!! I mean debates with my high school buddies. Debates with my fam who are all diehard Beatles fans. And you know what....i always for years picked Paul believe it or not. I loved his storytelling type of writing. Nothing too too personal in Paul’s tunes. They were just...:FUN. BUT now that I’m older I’m finding myself leading more towards JOHN and his style of raw honesty in writing. Honestly I got hung up on Yoko for WAY too much time and I actually let that woman affect my feelings on Johns and his songs. Such rubbish. I mean sure she’s garbage but she is what she is AND am she ain’t goin nowhere!! Lennon is not. He is beautiful.  He is serious. His music can be heartbreaking(happiness is a warm gun or Mother) it is just so dam deep that I shed a tear listening to it. Listen....I still And always WILL love Paul. But does his music make me cry? Not really. His music makes me happy like no other. I mean even his “sad@ songs bring a smile to me face! But John with songs like Dear Prudence and I Dig a Pony....bring me to another level and like I said earlier it starts with his honesty and sometimes by the end of the tune I’ve got tears in my eyes. Don’t let me down just hits me so hard....it’s incredible. Who knows? Maybe it’ll change back again someday!!  So what do you guys think?  Who wins over all for you......John or Paul?,0,1643649936

But apparently it is not the original one with acoustic instrument, it was more like the version of full instrument and some synthesizer keyboard, which was very beautiful.
But then i am not using soundcloud anymore and start using spotify, when i want to listen to that version of yesterday i cannot find it anywhere (spotify, YouTube, etc)
And when i try to surf soundcloud again i think the song is lost.

Revolution: Hard Rock

Happiness Is a Warm Gun: Grunge

A Day In the Life: Prog Rock

huge similarity between Revolution and Love Me Do, when you listen to them back to back. The “stomp” drumbeat and bass, the rock and roll chord structure, all of that. Revolution just has super distorted guitar and more political lyrics.",0,1643615972

TheBeatles,sd8tzt,MrC_Red,1,I Listened to the Beatles' Albums in One Week and Here are my Thoughts (Long Read),"For context, around a month ago, I'd decided to listen to the ""classic"" rock albums of all time, as I've only ever listened to rap music my whole life and wanted something new. As I went to different places to compile a list for the ""best of"" for rock albums, the Beatles albums CONSTANTLY were recommended; and not like 1 or 2, but 5 albums at time! So I decided to set a week in the future to listen to their discography and get them out of the way in one go. So after two weeks of listening to about 16 of the best rock albums, I decided it was time to listen to start my ""Beatles Week"". In chronological order and I have to listen to the album at least twice before moving on the the next one (I got through about 2 a day, the White Album had it's own day).


My thoughts going in was the generic ""the Beatles are okay, but they got to be overrated"" kind of stuff, but after 2 weeks of rock, from hard, grunge, metal, punk, classic, etc. I had a much more open mind. Full disclosure, I've only heard of TWO Beatles song and it was I Want To Hold Your Hand in 3rd grade and Come Together, from me attempting to give Abbey Road a listen about 5 years ago. So I had no real idea what to expect. Also, I didn't listen to every album, only the ones people said were ""worth listening to"". As well as no non album singles, I'll listen to them after I finished all the albums. 


• Please Please Me: I thought it was a fun album. I didn't think I would enjoy this style of music, but after a few tracks to get used to the style, I was pretty much sold. Twist and Shout was very surprising/humorous with John's performance and definitely stuck in my head the most from this one.

• Meet the Beatles: I thought this was just more of Please Please Me, which made it just as enjoyable. While I enjoyed the individual songs on here a bit more, I still like PPM more as a whole project. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" and it definitely wasn't broken.

• A Hard Day's Night: Definitely a step up from the first two. Not to sound dismissive, but this one felt like they were trying way more. There was more effort into the music here and I loved it. The title track is pretty awesome as well. (I saw there's a movie on this, and I'll definitely be checking it out in the future)

• Help!: Perfect follow up to AHDN, once again the effort in these songs really makes these two albums. The title track, Ticket to Ride, Yesterday (which is apparently the most covered song ever), I've Just Seen a Face, the tracks here are so much better here! Loved it. If this was their final album, I would've been satisfied with them. Not as ""GOAT"" status, but definitely not overrated.

• Rubber Soul: Holy shit!!! If the step up from MTB and AHDN was big, this is into another stratosphere of sound. They completely changed the style and sound (when they really didn't have to imo) and man did they pull it off with flying colors. I can't possibly pick a single song, the entire thing was amazing. I looked online and saw how influential this album was (something I was very interested in after two weeks of other rock albums), and it's great to see that it was such a landmark in music history. 

From this point on, every album after RS, I initially disliked/wasn't impressed on their first listen. It took a few playthroughs from them to click for me. I tried to listen to them at least 2 or 3 more times before moving on to the next album.

• Revolver: Yeah, didn't know what this was my first listen, super weird. I think I was just disappointed they changed up their style again when Rubber Soul was so incredible. I didn't like the mixture of sounds and preferred the consistent style of RS. After the third listen, I loved it. After the fifth listen, I think it's a masterpiece and their greatest album. My biggest flaw at first became it's strength, as it does so many unique things, that there's a lot of great things to enjoy. There's up to 3 different styles in a single song at times! Single songs on here have more complexity than some entire albums I've heard. I can't praise this album enough and I'm sure many articulated it much more and better than I ever could. So far, this is the best Rock album I've heard to this point.

• Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band: This was the one I was very interested to listen to, often topping many list. With my first listen, I was underwhelmed, felt like it was missing a few more songs. After background research on it's impact/influence, I've gain more respect for it. After a few more listens, I ended up loving it. While it doesn't reach the same highs as Revolver, it is insanely consistent in quality from song to song. Not a single weak point here, so I'll easily call it a ""perfect"" album. 

• Magical Mystery Tour: I think Meet the Beatles is a great comparison to this album, because it does feel like ""more of the same"" of Sgt. Pepper's. I believe Sgt. Pepper's loosened me up going in and I actually enjoyed this one on the first listen. A bunch of fun songs initially put this over Sgt. Pepper's for a time. But with multiple listens, the quality from track to track just doesn't hold up as much. It's fun, but isn't on the same level as the others so far.

• The Beatles ""The White Album"": The first ""long"" album in length so far, being a double album. Underwhelming the first listen, which I just assume will be the norm from now on lol. I thought it seemed super random and aimless with what it was doing. Also, it felt like a compilation album of the individual members, instead of a ""Beatles"" project. I like cohesive albums and this definitely wasn't it. After background research (wikipedia really), I saw the term Post-Modern and for some reason, it clicked for me on the 3rd listen. And once again, my original flaw is actually it's greatest strength. The more I listen to it, the better it becomes. It's touches on SOOO many different styles and genres, where there's always something great to find. Back in the USSR, Blackbird, Continuing the Story of Bungaloo Bill, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Helter Skelter, Cry Baby Cry, Yer Blues: all of these songs are all somehow on the same album, and somehow it works?! It doesn't have ""lows"", it just has songs that are just going for different things and by that definition, it's easily perfect. I do think if I listen to this more, it might surpass Revolver for me.

• Abbey Road: the most famous of their albums and the only one I heard of before my intro into rock music, but entirely forgot. Like before, felt pedestrian on the first go around. The 2nd listen I was genuinely confused on how anyone could think it was their best. On the 3rd listen it finally clicked for me when I saw how the album was divided (Side A, Side B), something I started to take note after the White Album. The first half has some great individual songs, but the second half...wow. The best flow/cohesiveness from track to track on side B rivals the entirety RS and SgtP. The ""Abbey Road Medley"" is pure perfection and I have come back to listen to it more than any portion of any album, like an addiction. It is SO great that is does cast a shadow over the first half a bit. If the first half was as cohesive as the second, it would be miles away my favorite album. The songs are still great (Come Together is the ""coolest"" song they made), but it's a ""it could've been better"" feeling when I judge the album as a whole. But it's the best of both worlds, with both the individual tracks and cohesive style, which I can respect. Perfect execution, so perfect album. If this was their final project, what a way to go out!

• Let It Be: Their ""final"" album and a bittersweet listen with that fact. I do love the ""live"" album feel to it with a bunch of the production stripped away. Which isn't on its face good or bad, but it immediately has it's unique sound, which is an accomplishment after so many albums. A lot of great tracks, but doesn't have that ""masterpiece"" track or run of songs, but I'll give it bonus points for it's consistent feel. I also love the random lines John says throughout, adds to that ""live"" feel. It's a solid project and a pretty satisfiable send-off. Of all of the albums, this is probably the best ""rainy day"" album; I can listen to this any time, and don't have to be in a certain mood to listen to it.

Final Thoughts

I originally finished Let It Be in the first week of January, but I got Covid soon after so I halted my rock album listenings for the time being. Doing so allowed me to really reflect on how great listening to the Beatles has been compared to most bands. The biggest flaw I've always had with rock music was the question, ""how can you make a ~45 min project with the same instruments and make it sound varied and non repetitive?"" More and more this question has been answered with so many albums and The Beatles discography made me realize just how silly of a question that is. I'll continue to listen to their music well after I'm done with this rock journey and Revolver could possibly make my personal top 5 in the future. When I originally started this journey, I just wanted to broaden my taste, but I've become more and more intrigued by the impact that Rock and Roll had on the musical landscape and gained respect for what it is way more than simply what it sounds like. The Beatles were inspired by tons of artists (quite a few black artists which I found cool! They were rarely brought up anywhere in my initial research, but the Beatles CONSTANTLY name dropped so many), and then tons of artists were inspired by the Beatles, and tons of artists became inspired by those inspired by the Beatles. (So far) I can't think of a single group that has influenced the mainstream sound of music than the Beatles, and with that, they easily earn my respect. Oh yeah, and their music is phenomenal as well",0,1643211693

TheBeatles,sct1hg,PerceptionSecret906,1,"I think the Beatles have always used classical elements, even on their first albums","Going through their discography I noticed this (even though I also hear everly brothers and etc). The song “all my loving” has a guitar in the background doing arpeggio throughout, something that was not in the everly brothers music or in any music at the time except for the classical music of the 1800s and 1900s. Another song is “ps I love you” which has a pseudo-arpeggio or full on arpeggio the whole song. Then you have the fact that their albums were formatted like movies/experiences (yes even their first albums) where each song contrasted another yet made for a cohesive experience. This was a sophisticated feature of their music and is more common in classical compositions.

There are easy listening examples like “if I fell”, “til there I was you”, “and I love her”, etc but you have to remember that easy listening comes from classical music.

The other classical elements other than the arpeggios I pointed out are a bit too subtle for me to explain, so I will listen more and figure it out.",0,1643158789

Or, at least, that’s what they’ll have you believe.

I think they’re actually saying “wrong chorus”; if you listen, you can’t really hear a misplayed chord there. What you can hear is one of the Beatles sing the wrong part of the chorus, stumbling over his words with his band mates.

   * Lennon composition and vocal
   * Certainly a start of the introspective lyrics vs the happy-go-lucky-young-love lyrics.
   * Somewhat inspired by the early folk period of Bob Dylan and country music: the fingerpicking, the twang, John's descending vocal lines, etc.
   * Also released as a B-side to their cover of Chuck Berry's Rock and Roll Music
* [Julia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZip_br_v3w)
   * Not only a Lennon composition and vocal... I think it's the rare Beatles track with John completely unaccompanied
   * Certainly can track how John's use of his own melancholy in his songs grew by this point:  it's an ode to his deceased mother.
   * Written during the visit to India, with some help from Donovan teaching John the finger-picking technique
   * Eventually released as a b-side to Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da in the 70s.

   * Quite famously Paul's attempt at raggae/ska
   * Title and chorus taken fairly directly from that of Jimmy Scott (an London-based Nigerian acquaintance of Paul's), who also played congas on the version of the track that was eventually released in Anthology 3.  Scott would later try to sue for part of the songwriting credit.
* [Please Mr. Postman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Kk5IG2b8E)
   * Cover of the Motown classic from the Marvelettes, with John on the lead vocal
   * Certainly shows how much the early Beatles work was influenced by the girl groups of the 50s and early 60s.

TheBeatles,s7szk8,exileondaytonst,1,Random Poll: I Call Your Name vs Tell Me Why,"So, I've been tracking polls done on this sub to help rank the entire discography, and these matchups I've been posting are actually chosen by a formula I put onto that spreadsheet that finds songs (and albums or eras of singles/b-sides) that haven't polled against each other.

The end result is that most of these matchups are b-sides or deep cuts that don't get much thought from the average fan.  I kind of like that, actually.  Part of the fun of getting into a band over a long term is being surprised every now and then by a song you've overlooked in the past.

I don't know if either of these songs will click with you, but they are...

* [I Call Your Name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5mzQHQxoSg)
   * B-Side on the Long Tall Sally EP
   * Lennon vocal, but more critically... it has a cowbell!
* [Tell Me Why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVub1QCUCGc)

TheBeatles,s3ptcq,RTPTheGoat,1,Free as a Bird Vs Real Love,"Whilst I love both of these songs I think it is clear that Real Love is a better song than Free as a Bird. 

I don’t understand why The Beatles chose to release Free as a Bird before Real Love and I believe if they had done they would’ve gotten a UK number 1. 

I know Real Love got to number 4 and Free as a Bird to number 2 but there was a lot more hype around Free as a Bird than Real Love.

I know that none of the remaining Beatles would’ve cared about the charts by this point but I just wished they had gotten one last number 1 to really cement their place as the greatest band of all time as they managed to get a number 1 over 20 years later

So does anyone agree with me and think Real Love is better than Free as a Bird? Please share your opinion

Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their time, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success: the Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worth of being saved. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand.

Revolution 9 is my least favourite track of all time (without including tracks that are just wind or that crap), it literally damages my brain.

Some of the most simple Beatles tracks are the most loved sometimes.

Ob-La-Dee Ob-La-Da is my favourite song from the entire White Album, followed by I Will and Martha My Dear.

I like While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Blackbird and Dear Prudence from the same album, but they are overrated.

Piggies, Rocky Racoon, Don't Pass Me By, Revolution 1, Honey Pie, WILD Honey Pie and WD'tWDIITR are underrated bangers! All of them are better to me than some of the most popular Beatles songs.

A Day In The Life and Tomorrow Never Knows are some of my favourite songs on the band... but I mostly enjoy them hyronically.

I enjoy Dig It hyronically.

All You Need Is Love is painfully average to me. So simple and repetitive...

Yellow Submarine &gt; All You Need Is Love.

Dig It &gt; All You Need Is Love (not kidding).

(All those songs I previously mentioned from the White Album except for Revolution 9) &gt; All You Need Is Love.

I Am The Walrus blows. I really don't see what do people see in that song.

(EVERY previous song mentioned except for Revolution 9) &gt; I Am The stupid Walrus.

Which makes me wonder... were there any George Beatles songs that you think might have actually sounded better if George had saved them for his solo career?

I love ""Long, Long, Long,"" but it sounds like they made George record the song from outside the studio. I think Phil Spector would have appreciated a song like this, and given it a more appropriate production, in the same vein as as ""Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp.""",0,1640541802

TheBeatles,rmve2g,st0rmy_day,1,Can we do a flashmob for the Russian book?,"Dear Redditers, I am speaking on behalf of my friend and a great Russian writer Yuliy Burkin.

Twenty years ago, in Siberia of all places, Yuliy with his friends wrote a novel *Shards of Sky*, which was both a humorous and tragic tale, published in multiple editions. Moreover, the readers laugh throughout the book and, at the end, cry.

*Shards of Sky* is based on real facts, but presented from unexpected perspectives. The book contains mysticism, which permeated the history of the Beatles, but which their biographers were keen to ignore.

For example, John invites Paul to join his group, and soon John’s mother dies. Paul invites George, and soon Paul’s mother dies. The three of them invite Ringo, whereupon their best friend Stuart Sutcliffe dies from a stroke. This fits in with karma – without knowing it, the Beatles came together to change the world, and the Universe resisted, killing off their closest people, including Brian Epstein. The *Shards of Sky* story is built on such revelations.

Many believe that it was the Beatles’ influence in the 1960s that avoided a Third World War. The global situation nowadays requires their re-emergence, albeit in a film, but made possible with your talent.

Recently the film *Bohemian Rhapsody* about Queen was premiered to great acclaim.  Yet the Beatles were/are of much greater importance and their story was/is much more entertaining and dramatic. A bright, humorous and simultaneously tragic tale of their rise and fall, filmed by you, cannot fail to be successful and, perhaps, change the world for the better.

There is nothing surprising in the fact that the book was written by Russian authors, for it is often true that great things are seen from afar and also, in the 1960-70s behind the Iron Curtain, the Beatles were a kind of religion for Russians. Furthermore, it could be argued that two Siberians writing a great book about the Beatles is no more surprising than four provincial Liverpudlians conquering the world with their music, or a director from New Zealand shooting the greatest films in the history of cinematography.

Yes, I am talking about Peter Jackson. My friend has a dream that the book can be filmed by this incredible director.

And that's the point of the flashmob: can Russian writer reach to Peter Jackson and propose the book to him?

If you want to help, just spread the letter to PJ via this link: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MYR3up7fQHrl\_Fkbq8pGt0xen8mP4oRSVecMFzlvOc8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MYR3up7fQHrl_Fkbq8pGt0xen8mP4oRSVecMFzlvOc8/edit?usp=sharing)

‘Listen, the Snow is Falling’ was recorded alongside John Lennon’s 1971 song ‘Happy Xmas (War Is Over)’ and first released as a b-side to the single. It features Yoko singing atop the rustle of steps in snow, gusting winds and John Lennon’s guitar - while her gentle voice hypnotically repeats ‘snow is falling all the time’, atop the shimmer of sleigh bells.

Directed by Lance Bangs and executive produced by Dhani Harrison and David Zonshine, the video stars Fred Armisen and Vanessa Bayer as metaphysical special agents who are tasked by the head of a clandestine agency, played by Mark Hamill, to search for that which can’t be seen.**

Along the way dozens of agents team up to look high and low for what may have been right in front of their face all along, mirroring the seeking nature of the song. More than forty musicians, actors, comedians, directors, artists and other creatives make appearances, ranging from Harrison’s friends and former band mates **Ringo Starr** and **Jeff Lynne**; to actors **Darren Criss**, **Jon Hamm**, **Rosanna Arquette**; musicians **Joe Walsh, “Weird** **Al” Yankovic**, **Reggie Watts**, comedians **Moshe Kasher**, **Natasha Leggero,** **Patton Oswalt**; comedy duos **Tim and Eric** (**Tim Heidecker** and **Eric Wareheim**) and **Garfunkel and Oates** (**Kate Micucci** and **Riki Lindhome**); and others like writer, actor, director **Taika Waititi** ('What We Do In The Shadows,' 'Jojo Rabbit,' 'Thor') and visual artist **Shepard Fairey**. The video also features Harrison’s wife **Olivia Harrison** and their son **Dhani Harrison**, who appear in scenes with actress **Aimee Mullins** and actor **Rupert Friend**, respectively. The full cast list in order of appearance is below.

In addition to Harrison’s massive influence on popular music as a member of The Beatles and his successful solo career, the legendary songwriter, musician, film producer and peace activist also greatly influenced the comedy world through his groundbreaking British film studio, HandMade Films, which was responsible for such classic films as Monty Python’s 'Life Of Brian,' 'Time Bandits' and the cult favourite, 'Withnail and I.' This music video pays tribute to Harrison’s sense of humour and his indelible impact on both music and comedy.

TheBeatles,rebr8k,JudasCrinitus,1,How would The Beatles and music at large look with Stuart Sutcliffe a permanent member of the band?,"Let's assume an alternate timeline where Stuart Sutcliffe decided to stick with The Beatles - and also hadn't had that head injury and subsequent fatal hemorrhage. Otherwise, let's assume Best was still fired and Ringo hired by the time they release first album.

What does the trajectory of The Beatles look like with Stuart on board? How do the band dynamics and interpersonal stresses play out with him there? How does their music evolve? Do they still break up? Do they break up earlier? Do they reach the same heights of fame? Do they have the same impact on the future of the music industry and rock and roll music?

Just curious what others think what might have been had things gone differently.",0,1639265822

Sometimes I forget that these four were normal people who also liked to play with kids lol

-	Similarly, many of the song’s lyrics seem to come very quickly. Did he have these lyrics ready, or were they invented on the spot with the music, as it appears?
-	He’s strumming on a bass guitar during the process. Is this a common way of playing bass? I’ve never seen it before.

TheBeatles,r9uq9u,Faz_Dillinger,1,George Harrison solution,"Been a Beatles fan for awhile and just watched the Get Back documentary.  There was clearly an ongoing issue of George’s material not being taken seriously enough (surprising cause George’s songs are some of my favorites on a lot of their albums). 

The solution was so clear and he said it in the doc. He should’ve sold his songs to other acts. These were clearly hits and they would’ve gone up the charts. I believe if John/Paul saw that enough they would’ve had to take his material more seriously (George clearly had more than enough material he put out a triple album not too long after this). 

This would’ve brought some equilibrium to that situation and allowed the Beatles to sustain long term. There were obviously other issues but on that single front it could’ve clearly been dealt with.",4,1638753327

George Martin was around for the whole process, making suggestions, throwing ideas into the hat, you know doing things a producer does. Spector was no where around for this recording sessions. As I understand, he was later hired to take the recordings and make them into an album, but why would that be considered a production credit, rather than a mixing credit? This bothers me more than it should I guess, considering Paul’s “Naked” mix is actually superior IMO. I just love George Martin and believe he deserves the credit.",3,1638570055

After stumbling and fumbling through most of his tracks for the whole rehearsal and recording, where it seems like John can't find the focus or energy to really nail the songs he ends up recording the majority of his contributions to the album on the roof when the pressure is at its highest. John ends up being the only one to really live up to the idea that they set out to accomplish, to record live. And in spite of all the sub optimal conditions, the cold, the wind, the pressure of performing in public for the first time in years, he nails his songs giving his best vocal performances of the whole documentary. If he hadn't flubbed the line in Don't let me down they probably would have gone with that first take on the roof as well as he sounds amazing.

Having watched all three episodes of the stunning 'Get Back' documentary, and given it's been 20 years this week since George sadly passed away, I thought now was as good a time as any to feature this superb solo effort from 'the quiet one'.

I was chatting with a friend this week in regards to the fact Yoko is seemingly (and understandably) happy she's been shown in a different light in the new film and is apparently, no longer to blame for the break up of the worlds greatest band. Personally, having read many books on The Beatles and having watched endless footage of interviews of all four members, I concluded a long time ago that George was the main reason for the break-up.

Especially after watching get back… for some, they realized why they disliked Paul even more but honestly I love him. Paul was in essence forced to take over the band and keep pushing them to drive for success once John started fading from the “leader” of the band. I think Paul is a perfectionist and to many, that’s irritating, especially to work with. But look at the success they all brought in, the hits, the beatlemania, the everlasting love for the band so many years after they have broken up. Not only do I believe Paul is a great member of the band, I feel as though the song “Hey Jude” is remarkable (obviously…) but it just showed Paul was also a father as well as a Beatle. John was so wrapped up in himself he believed it was written to go after yoko… while Paul was Julian’s comfort during the hard time which led to John abandoning his son for those years. I do believe Paul was also very caught up in the fame and his hunger for it was very present, BUT without him acting that way… imagine what Let it Be would have been. I think everyone in the band knew they were talented and felt like they no longer needed to work as hard as they did before to produce successful songs but Paul kept pushing them and that’s why there was tension because Paul was again… a perfectionist.

Lindsay-Hogg edited these recordings, which became the** ***Let It Be*** **movie.**

In 2019 Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit) was given access to all of the 57 hours of footage, which he restored and edited down to just under eight hours for the three-part Disney+ documentary. This hardcover book features a foreword from Peter Jackson, an introduction from Hanif Kureishi and background context to the bands’ time in Twickenham, Apple Studios and their final live performance on top of Apple Studios from John Harris. Harris does this across three acts and an afterword.

Problem is, there seems to be a half dozen or so versions of the album, some remastered, some not, some with bonus tracks, others with different bonus tracks, etc, and frankly it's giving me a headache. As long as the original core album is there, I don't care what supplementary material is there. However, I DO care about the mixing/mastering an awful lot. I want to get the ideal version of it (especially seeing as I listened to the 2009 stereo remasters of the Beatles discography and only recently learned that the audio panning makes me enjoy them considerably less) but I have no clue what version that might be. I would try and listen to them all, but this album is a beast, and I just don't have the time. Normally I'd go for the most recent remastering, but I've read tons of reviews that the 50th anniversary edition has some muddy/not ideal mixes on some songs, so I'm at a loss. Anyone know anything about which version is the ideal one?",11,1638255972

TheBeatles,r4m5g9,Dissolver64,1,How would a 1969 double album have compared to their 1968 double album?,"One thing that struck me when watching Get Back, was just how many songs they had written and recorded in 1969. By the end of January they have pretty much the entire Let It Be album recorded, although they weren't sure what to do with the material at the time. By September they've also recorded all the songs for Abbey Road. So they're sitting on two full albums of material, enough to have released another double album, similar to the White Album, if they had wanted to.

I'm glad they opted to release Abbey Road, in all its polished brilliance, but it is interesting to ponder how a 1969 double album would have turned out, perhaps they still could have had the medley on the last side. What do you guys think, considering the songs they had at the time, would it have been better or worse than the White Album?",1,1638156178

TheBeatles,r4fuzv,KrisBkh,1,Yoko Fucking Ono!,"So I’m half way through episode 2. Just seeing her sat in the studio while the lads are recording was the final nail in the coffin for me. I’ve literally paused the episode to come here and rant about her.

What is she doing there?? I had to bite my tongue at the start of the episode when she refers to the Beatles as “we” meaning she must have seen herself as one of them! 🤬

Bear in mind at this point Paul, George and Ringo are married or pretty much on the verge of being married themselves. Their Mrs are no where to be seen? Why? Because who the fuck takes their Mrs to work!?!

I love my partner to death but if she asked to come to work with me I’d laugh historically, kiss her on cheek and say something like “you’re funny, I’ll see you tonight” grab my shit and hit the door! But Lennon actually entertained this woman. Why?? I heard he had mummy issues so maybe he couldn’t say no to her……

It annoys me because she obviously seen herself as an artist and it feels like she’s just riding the bands coat tails to stay relevant. Bitch!!

Y’all think he was zapped on heroin at some points? It would really explain his lack of enthusiasm honestly. And from my understanding he started using heroin just a year or two before this documentary was shot. Also notice there are times when him and Yoko are MIA and then show back up. Theres one part in the first episode where him and Yoko show back up and he just seems completely zapped. 

Also this isn’t a post to bash on John or his drug use, I’m actually intrigued by his drug use. Let me know what y’all think? Peace",52,1638122265

TheBeatles,r3cfvh,alex-hedges,1,Did anyone else find the Get Back documentary really unsatisfying?,"Just finished part 3 and firstly I’m surprised by how much it’s decreased my opinion of the Let It Be album musically, it’s hard to believe this band was so experimental and cutting edge not long before the documentary takes place, it seems like the band’s no longer interested in that sound and would rather produce fairly uninspired, unoriginal blues rock, it almost seems as though their sound has devolved, not once during the documentary did anyone involved seemed to be bothered at all about experimenting and trying to push their sound forward, they all seemed burnt out musically.

Secondly I believe the documentary itself is very well-made, well-edited and I don’t have many complaints in that department, perhaps some parts dragged on but for me I was happy being in the same room as the Beatles for 8 ish hours, my main feeling is that it was like a documentary about a 3 course meal that ended after the 1st course, while the rooftop gig is great I already felt a bit bored of some of the tracks after hearing them be rehearsed countless times. The Beatles break-up has been pretty well documented but it just felt like that was the break-up was the obvious ending for the documentary, that’s why the ending felt so unsatisfying because I knew that much more happened after, things that to me were a lot more interesting then the rooftop show.

I’m interested to see what Beatles fans’ opinions are on this documentary. Perhaps a Let It Be era Beatles fan loved it.",1,1638015410

TheBeatles,r39qj2,KonovanIsMe,1,My thoughts on Part 1 of Get Back,"Every one else seems to be making one of these lists so I thought I'd do the same. I've been looking forward to this doco for god knows how long and I think Peter Jackson's completely nailed it imo. Some of the things I found interesting were:
 
* How immersed I felt in the period, the late 60s has become a very important and well-discussed era of modern history. I loved how the film managed to make the time feel so real and more relatable than most other media. You really get the sense that both the people and the setting are just as real as the 21st century.
* I thought it was pretty funny (and completely unsurprising) how casually and often Paul was able to procure a blunt in the middle of filming. From the look of it it seems like he always carried weed with him lol.  He's obviously known as one of the biggest stoner's in music so it was amusing to see the more candid side of him.
* I thought it was really interesting to see the dynamic between the band and the studio employees/ common people. It was funny to see how well fed and taken care of they were made. Its difficult to get the sense of how big Beatlemania was when you weren't alive at the time but its clear that everybody really, really likes the beatles and want to keep them satisfied.
* It definitely seems like a core aspect of the miniseries will be the relationship between Paul and George. I didn't get the sense that Paul was acting like too much of an ass, but it seems like George had a very small ego (it was interesting to see how open he was about Clapton being a better guitarist) which made it easy for the control freak Paul  to override him.
* Yoko acted exactly like I thought she would lol

These were just the thoughts that were on the top of my head. I'm definitely looking forward to the next two as this seems like the biggest beatles related project since mabye Anthology.",4,1638004063

It has twelve songs on it and to me, only 6 out of those 12 are keepers... and that's a low ratio for the beatles.

Two of us: is awesome

Dig a pony: is okay, just okay imo

Across the Universe: is one of my favorite songs ever 

I me mine: isn't very compelling 

Dig it: I know it's meant to be silly, but it's inconsequential. 

Let it be: is beautiful

Maggie Mae: inconsequential. 

I've got a feeling: is great

One after 909: I know it's one of John and Paul's ealiest collaborations and I appreicate that, but I'm not that interested. 

Long and Winding Road: I love it. With or without Spector's additions. 

For you Blue: not very interesting. How George could have had Any track off All things must pass rejected but had this song make the album is beyond me

Get Back is great, and a classic.


Out of 12 songs, I feel only six are fully resolved. 
I understand they wanted it to feel loose and naturalistic and at  times, it worked. But is Let it be really on par with their other albums?

I think it could have been an EP, or a series of stand along singles, but the album leaves me slightly disappointed. 

I'm not being a troll, and I totally get it's subjective. These are just my thoughts.

TheBeatles,r2y0nf,NerdNeck1o1,1,My thoughts on Get Back pt 1,"I’ve seen several opinions on Get Back so far and I agree with some disagree with others.

- I don’t see Yoko being a nuisance, she hardly talked at all during the film. The only controversial thing I saw was her singing during the jam after George left, but everyone seemed to be into it. I will say the screaming Johns name was weird

- I don’t think the film changes what we know about the conflicting personalities of the Beatles at the time. Paul was controlling,  George was feeling under appreciated, and John being disinterested

- I’ve seen people say Paul brushed aside George’s ideas, but he played through a couple and chatted about lyrics. I think if Paul was dismissive it’s because he was aware of the daunting task ahead and was trying to do as much as he could to get ahead of it. It’s probably easier for Paul to try and work on his own pieces than to spend time helping George or inspire John.",23,1637964397
TheBeatles,r2vnel,ipsilateralbrain,1,My thoughts/takeaways on Get Back part 1:,"Some takeaways from part 1:

- Paul is so into himself it’s almost nauseating? But he did get things done… what he wanted to get done at least 😉

- George constantly advocating for himself and Paul turning him down are some of the most heart wrenching moments. Paul does not respect his band mates, and it’s telling. 

- Yoko really was just obnoxiously sitting there between Paul and John. 

- John could clearly only take Paul in doses, constantly missing (probably to do drugs with Yoko so he wouldn’t get overwhelmed by Paul’s obsessive nature) 

- Linda and Yoko hanging out stoned together was shocking

- Ringo was the most patient with everyone, and you could tell he just wanted everyone to be happy

To be clear, I’m a HUGE fan of Paul, that’s clear, I know he’s a talented SOB but his behavior during this time was textbook ego maniac and that’s just something George and John fans have accepted for decades, but now we see it for what it was.

All of their music is amazing and unmatched, but “Revolver” and “Rubber Soul” specifically while trippin is something else. Sgt peppers is an honorable mention as well. Anyway “I’m only sleeping” is so great. While I relate it more to mushrooms, it’s definetly about lsd as that’s what they used. I relate it to mushrooms more so because they give me that “sleepy feeling” while acid wakes me up. But it’s definitely different for everyone. Either way I definitely “stay in bed and float upstream” on both substances lol.

If you haven’t heard this song I highly recommend you listen to it while trippin or sober, as well as both albums I mentioned in their entirety. Or just any music from them is good haha.

For me, the best version is the one Glyn Johns mixed (but mostly for the perfomance, I think its a great take). Of course the one from the rooftop it's so good as well. I remember some years ago when I had 13 years old I used to listen to that version (that I think I found randomly through the internet) thinking that it was the original version of the album. Then I realized that it wasn't and for years I wasn't able to find that version and i was so frustrated. I was so happy when I found it again on the super deluxe release.

For me its the best cause the energy of that take it's soo chill and groovy. I really like hearing John saying ""hit it Bill"" and then that amazing rhodes solo gives me goosebumps all the time :D",1,1637568652

What is the last time all four Beatles recorded a take of a song together?

I know that I Me Mine (Take 16) is the last take ever recorded for a Beatles song, but John wasn't there. They included that take at the end of the Anthology series.

I also know that the last time all four were in the studio together was August 20, 1969, but that wasn't a recording session. That was a mixing session as well as the group deciding the running order for the Abbey Road album.

So, does anyone happen to know the last time that all four Beatles were present in the studio and all playing at the same time? Just from a historical perspective I think it would be a cool thing to know.",17,1637358337

TheBeatles,qwheda,Shittydaydream,1,I’m looking for an early YouTube music for “Day in The Life” might’ve been fan made. This was before the Beatles had an official YouTube channel.,"This music video haunts me to this day. It was 2008 and I just got a computer and an MP3 player so I began looking for artist music to put on my MP3 player so I came across The Beatles and was instantly hooked. I began diving into their discography downloading any song I could find. I began looking them up on YouTube for music videos, concerts vids etc. 

I came across a music video for “A Day In The Life” that featured the real Beatles or I believe it did atleast. The music video was the Beatles preforming a day in life spliced together with a cut of Paul McCartney Driving a car. A blonde woman was in the passenger seat. I believe Paul McCartney might’ve been bearded?? He was putting his hand on her thigh and as the music got more intense he was running his hand up it. Then the part where the music stops and become him singing the clip stopped and cut to him singing his part. 

The editing of the video looked very 60s. And the camera quality was that of what It would’ve been back then. It might’ve been fanmade but I swear it was the real Beatles. Does anyone have any info on this? Or a link to the video ?
It might’ve been a fan made video splicing together scene from magical mystery tour . Idk help please!",10,1637208869

And if you wonder how much respect he had from his peers at the time, watch how deliberate Clapton and especially Keith Richards are when backing him in this video.

The band had Lennon playing rhythm. Eric Clapton on lead guitar, Keith Richards on bass and Mitch Mitchell (of the Jimi Hendrix Experience) on drums.

TheBeatles,qsuw00,RainBowSwift71532,1,Were they really that loud??,"I'm a new Beatles fan I mean I knew of them but just never got into their music catalog. I've only recently got into their music through their game ""The Beatles Rock Band"" (Which I love and play everyday). 


Anyways in the settings of that game there's an option you can turn on or off. Called ""Realistic Mode"" and basically what that does is jacks up the volume of crowd. I don't know the exact percent but for example the crowd would be 90% and the actual music would be at 10%. 


I assume since it's called ""Realistic Mode"" that was actually real. So my question is. When at a Beatles concert were the fans actually that loud? To the point where you couldn't hear the music. A buddy of mine was telling me that if you were there and you stood right in the middle of the speakers. 


Where you had one speaker on the left side and the other speaker on the right. You'd go deaf from the screaming fans alone. Even if your ear was right up against the speakers you'd go deaf from the fans because that's how loud they were. 


Then again I don't know how accurate that is. Correct me if I'm wrong but I read somewhere. Where John said he would sing different lyrics when performing a song and the fans wouldn't notice because of how loud they were screaming.",11,1636783642

TheBeatles,qrgiq2,RainBowSwift71532,1,Which version is the best version to get??,"So I'm looking to get The Beatles on vinyl and I'm looking to get it all. So all the albums, singles, compilations, deluxe, super deluxe, any and all box sets/collections etc etc etc. But I need help which versions are the best versions to buy. 

I say that because I was watching a YouTuber by the name of ""Parlogram Auctions"" (Which is one of my favorite Beatles related YouTuber/channel) and he does a lot of Beatles vinyl related videos. And while watching some his videos I noticed when he's talking about an album. For example when he was talking about ""Rubber Soul"". He mentioned the US stereo pressing has the false start of ""I'm Looking Through You"" which isn't on mono version.

Then the US capital album has a Nov 9th mix of Michelle. Whereas the UK version has the later Nov 15th mix. Then you have all the different various mono pressing 1960's mono pressing -1, -4, -5, 1981 mono pressing, then the 2014 pressing, then there's the US pressing from capital. Then there's a pressing of ""Rubber Soul"" which is known as the ""Loud Cut"".

He was also saying how this song or album was cut from the original UK mono mix. And then this pressing of the album was cut from stereo mix etc, etc, etc.

In my head what I saw was me going to the Beatles website. And the complete album collection box set add to cart. The complete singles collection box set add to cart. The complete picture disc singles collection box set add to cart. Any and all box set/deluxe/super deluxe albums add to cart.

Correct me if I'm wrong but from what I've seen so far it seems like. For example let's say ""Let It Be"" there will be this pressing that has bad sound quality. But has this mix of ""Get Back"". Whereas this pressing may have amazing sound quality but instead may have this mix of ""Get Back"". And it's like well I love this mix of ""Get Back"" but don't really want the bad sound. Where on the other hand I don't really like this mix of ""Get Back"" but I really want the good sound quality.

Is there a sort of like spreadsheet that has all the albums and various pressing. Kind of detailing OK this mono UK 1965 pressing has the best sound quality. This mix of this song etc, etc, etc. Then next will be the US 2014 pressing detailing this version doesn't have great sound quality etc, etc, etc. If something like that doesn't exist. 

I would love for someone to make something like that. It would be very helpful for new Beatles fans such as myself. Who wants to buy their catoulge on vinyl. And want to get the best sounding copies. That way they can know which pressing, reissue, remaster, 1st pressing, collection, box set, UK pressing, US pressing, has the best version. With the best sound quality, best mix, etc, etc, etc.",4,1636618597

I always think of the song as an ambient and moody song, which will play in a "" lonely in the rain"" sequence. Just has that aesthetic to me, and. Patel's version gets it right and feels more soulful and idk hard hitting while also being chill.
The orchestral feel of the original feels kind of clunky 
While the naked version seems to feel a bit more like a pop tune and doesn't quite hit the emotional notes for me.

TheBeatles,qmkywr,Responsible-Run-904,1,Help find this beatles fanfiction.,"Alright so in the midst of living my adult life I was reminded of this one Beatles fanfic I read years ago. I believe it may have been written in the late 99s or early 2000s, but I can’t be sure.
I apologise for not having the name of it though the premise is as follows:
The point of view was aomewhat in the format of an interview (someone was asking the protagonist to recount their past experience with the band)
The protagonist was Paul’s sister (can’t remember her name)
She ends up falling in love with George but it takes a while for them to actually get together.
I believe she ended up being one of the band members, though not until after their Hamburg days (originally a cello player I think) and contributed greatly to songs like Eleanor Rigby.
There was this one scene towards the end of the fic where the author describes her and Paul embracing on the floor of a bedroom after the death of Linda in a very sweet sibling moment (them both having lost so much, especially due to cancer). Idk why this part stuck out so much as to be one of the only bits I remember of this fic.

Anywho, if anyone could help me find this I’m really interested in rereading it and seeing if it’s actually as good as I remember, or if it was just my tweeny perception and lack of literary exposure that made me think it was so good.

Thanks!",3,1636033692

TheBeatles,qjqzzr,Araknhak,1,"I got introduced to The Beatles, became obsessed with their music and eventually created a sub in honour of my favourite Beatle. This is my short, ADHD obsession story!","I am diagnosed with ADHD combined type. This year my gf introduced me to The Beatles and I have been completely hooked ever since. I knew the band before her, of course, but I hadn’t really delved into their music too much. Now I listen to them pretty much every day and I’ve gone through many albums like mad. A month ago or something, I got an idea, it started as a joke which quickly grew into reality. Realizing my favourite Beatle Ringo Starr didn’t have a proper sub, and with a little help from my friend Vyvanse 30mg, I decided to create one in his honour: [r/RingoStarr](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingoStarr/).

Ever since, I have poured hours and days into the community to develop it and make it grow. I have developed proper rules, advertised a lot, worked on the aesthetics, created lots of content and I am currently working on a ranking system. I have even spent hours programming the automoderator to do several different things, many of them hidden from the members as a surprise to be triggered. Needless to say, I have become COMPLETELY OBSESSED with the sub. For me personally, I would say that the goal of it all is simply to make it grow to match the size of the other Beatle member’s subs, as well as keeping the members engaged and active.

Thanks for reading this stupid obsession of mine, and if you’re also a fan of Ringo or The Beatles, make sure to join us on [r/RingoStarr](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingoStarr/). Anyone is welcome, no matter your background!

first half with john:

a man, breaking the fourth wall, wanders through the street while talking about his day. he shows us the paper and exclaims about how depressing it is, then proceeds to talk about he forced himself to watch a bad movie solely because he had read the book and all. once he’s done, he smiles weakly and takes a whiff of his cigarette, mumbling the ominous “id love to turn.. you.. on..”

orchestral buildup #1:

he begins to walk to his friend’s work to visit, but as he’s crossing the street, all sorts of horrifying stuff is happening behind him. buildings are burning, cars are being crashed into one another, people are manhandling each other, and he’s oblivious to it all while it merely happens only a couple of inches away from him.

second half with paul:

pov change now. we see his friend wake up as the sun shines outside, rolling out of bed and getting for yet another day of work. he realizes he’s late, scurries a bit, and finally makes it to his job after his bus ride. he goes upstairs to the break room to have a quick smoke, but once he does so, he begins to dissociate and witness certain surrealistic visions involving a bunch of people in his life, including his friend, who appears as if he’s falling with him


third half with john:

back to man #1’s pov. he walks into his friend’s work, groaning loudly about his day and slumping beside him as he fetches his own cigarette. the two converse, him talking something mildly entertaining he had read on the news, before sighing and getting up to leave, all while looking to the audience once more and mumbling, “i’d love to turn.. you.. on..”

orchestral buildup #2/finale:

man #1 begins to leave the building, taking a different way home now, but everything from before begins to happen now. all sorts of terror breaks out, and it’s nothing he notices or pays any mind to, but as it inches closer and closer, it all of a sudden stops as he reaches his front door. but as he reaches his front door, he turns around and is suddenly shot, his body hitting the ground right on time with the final piano slam. the final shot varies back and forth from his demise, people mindlessly wandering and stepping over his body, to his friend at work, staring out the window in deep thought.

story meaning:

in general, i interpret this little story of mine as “every day in your life could be your last, as you honestly escape death every single day, sometimes without even knowing that it was even close to begin with. some days life can be a lot more simplistic and oblivious, and some can be a lot more hyperaware of the world around them. nonetheless, we all have the same chance of dying at anytime, anywhere”",0,1635597801

TheBeatles,qf9hl2,zillitch,1,Edited concept discography with my thoughts,"Please Please Me 

I used the single From Me To You with the B side Thank You Girl for Please Please Me, making the title track the opening track as well, followed by From Me To You and Love Me Do (all harmonica openings), which follows the format they continued with the rest of their LP’s starting with With The Beatles (strong opening three originals). I follow Love Me Do with P.S. I Love You (side 2 starts with Love Me Do and P.S. I Love You)(also Please Please ME, From ME To YOU, Love ME DO, P.S. I Love YOU (title 1 has only Me, titles 2 &amp; 3 have Me and You(or Do), and title 4 has only You). I thought A Taste Of Honey sounded good next to P.S. I Love You. Side one ends with A Taste Of Honey, followed by Do You Want To Know A Secret and Misery, party because they all open with a single guitar strum. Side Two opens with I Saw Her Standing There, followed by Thank You Girl because the titles fit together and they’re both stanky songs and I Saw Her Standing is an iconic opening. Ask Me Why is a faster song as well but on the mellower side so I think it follows well from the upbeat opening two tracks of side one (I Saw Her Standing There, Thank You Girl), and follows well with Baby It’s You which is mellow as well as slow and the titles match (Ask Me Why: Baby It’s You). I followed with Boys to bring it back up to speed and follow with Twist And Shout (despite the fact that they saved it for the end of the third session of their marathon recording of Please Please Me because of John’s vocal fry) and There’s A Place as the closing track as it’s an original and fits maybe (also Pease Please Me and There’s A Place have the same opening thing with bass kinda).

With The Beatles 

I added the singles She Loves You, This Boy, and I Want To Hold Your Hand (originally released with This Boy as it’s B side in the UK) to With The Beatles. I kept the original opening three tracks, but replaced Don’t Bother Me (#4 side 1) with This Boy (also All My Loving was released in Canada with This Boy as it’s B Side). I follow up with Devil In Her Heart and Please Mister Postman (originally closes side 1),  and close with Till There Was You (great flow with these songs...). I open side two with She Loves You instead, following with Roll Over Beethoven (originally opens side 2), and continuing the harder sound with Hold Me Tight and I Want To Hold Your Hand. I close the album with You Really Got A Hold On Me (HOLD Me Tight, I Want To HOLD Your Hand, You Really Got A HOLD On Me), Not A Second Time, and Money(That’s What I Want)(originally closes the album)(all are piano intros which is good I think and it sounds good).

I left side 1 untouched, left the opening of side 2 (Any Time At All), and the close of side two (I’ll Be Back) untouched as well, but switched around the core of side 2 with I Call Your Name right before I’ll Be Back (I think it’s snug there following You Can’t Do That—also cowbell). I rearranged the three songs in between Any Time At All and You Can’t Do That from being originally I’ll Cry Instead and Things We Said Today and When I Get Home to Things We Said Today and When I Get Home and I’ll Cry Instead. 

Side One
1. A Hard Day’s Night
2. I Should Have Known Better
3. If I Fell
4. I’m Happy Just To Dance With You
5. And I Love Her
6. Tell Me Why
7. Can’t Buy Me Love

Side Two
1. Any Time At All
2. Things We Said Today
3. When I Get Home
4. I’ll Cry Instead
5. You Can’t Do That
6. I Call Your Name
7. I’ll Be Back

Beatles For Sale

I added I Feel Fine, Long Tall Sally, and I’m Down to Beatles For Sale (I’m Down (style of Little Richard) was B side to Help!, but the group was doing Long Tall Sally since 1957 (cover of Little Richard)(both I’m Down and Long Tall Sally were frequent closing acts). I open with I Feel Fine and keep I’m A Loser where it is (I Feel Fine contrast with I’m A Loser of course), and follow with No Reply which has a similar sound to I’ll Follow The Sun (also contrast again with No Reply vs I’ll Follow The Sun). I Don’t Want To Spoil The Party blends into Rock And Roll Music and closes with Long Tall Sally (last song performed in front of a paying audience). Side 2 starts with What You’re Doing followed by Eight Days A Week (What You’re Doing fades out at the end while Eight Days A Week fades in), and next is Every Little Thing and Words Of Love. BABY’s In Black is followed by Everybody’s Trying To Be My BABY (which originally closes the album), and the album closes with I’m Down (frequent close between 65 and 66 tours).

Side One
1. I Feel Fine
2. I’m A Loser
3. No Reply
4. I’ll Follow The Sun
5. I Don’t Want To Spoil The Party
6. Rock And Roll Music
7. Long Tall Sally

Help! 

I replaced Dizzy Miss Lizzy with Drive My Car from Rubber Soul because I think it fits really well on Help!. I kept side 1 the same but replaced You’re Going To Lose That Girl with Act Naturally. I start side 2 with Drive My Car (Ticket To Ride to Drive My Car), and follow with You Like Me Too Much and You’re Going To Lose That Girl (piano on all three haha). The album originally ends with I’ve Just Seen A Face, Yesterday, and Dizzy Miss Lizzy but since I removed the cover I end the album with Tell Me What You See and I’ve Just Seen A Face (originally next to each other (tell me what you see: I’ve just seen a face), followed by Yesterday. I thought It’s Only Love fit snug in between You’re Going To Lose That Girl and Tell Me What You See.

Side One
1. Help!
2. The Night Before
3. You’ve Got To Hide Your Love Away
4. I Need You

Rubber Soul

I added the singles Day Tripper and We Can Work It Out to Rubber Soul, and I open with Day Tripper, Nowhere Man, and You Wont See Me (day tripper becomes nowhere man so you won’t see him) followed by We Can Work It Out because tambourine in You Wont See Me. I think I’m Looking Through You is a good ending to side 1, picked up by Norwegian Wood and Michelle on side 2. I thought the title play for the close of the album with If I Needed Someone and In My Life was good. Also Wait, The Word, Think For Yourself makes sense maybe. 

Side One
1. Day Tripper
2. Nowhere Man
3. You Won’t See Me
4. We Can Work It Out
5. What Goes On
6. Girl

Revolver 

I added Paperback Writer and Rain to Revolver. Opening three songs of Revolver are perfect, after I’m Only Sleeping comes Yellow Submarine and Good Day Sunshine (the yellow submarine as metaphor for the sun and the Beatles and happiness)(also one vocal performance from George, Paul, John, and Ringo). Next is And Your Bird Can Sing and side 1 closes with Rain (birds sing in the sunny rain for feeding time). I start side 2 with Paperback Writer and She Said She Said, contrast with For No One and then I Want To Tell You (the end of For No One fades out, and I Want To Tell You fades in). Once again contrast with Here, There and Everywhere, and then I kept the closing two songs the same. 

Side One
1. Taxman 
2. Eleanor Rigby
3. I’m Only Sleeping
4. Yellow Submarine 
5. Good Day Sunshine
6. And Your Bird Can Sing

Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band

I added Hello, Goodbye, Penny Lane, I Am The Walrus, Strawberry Fields Forever, and All You Need Is Love to Sgt. Peppers. I kept the opening six songs the same, but I close side one with Hello, Goodbye right after She’s Leaving Home (both have strings too). I start side 2 with Penny Lane, followed by Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite! (originally opens side 2), I Am The Walrus, and Good Morning Good Morning (all seems to flow well maybe). I end with Strawberry Fields Forever, Lovely Rita, and All You Need Is Love (red imagery with love and strawberries)(also All You Need Is Love and its opening just seems to fit too well as the close of Sgt Pepper). 

Side One
1. Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band
2. With A Little Help From My Friends
3. Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds

Magical Mystery Tour 

I start MMT with the title track, but then the crew goes to Crackerbox Palace upon a hill, where lives a Fool... from the hill a giant bluejay swoops up the crew and others, where they are Flying... to India, so the last two songs on side two are Love You To (opens India) and the closer Within You Without You. The Inner Light starts act 2 of the film and side 2 of LP as it shines and then the crew heads back with the bluejay (cue Blue Jay Way). The bluejay lands and introduces them to some pigs (cue an alternative version of George’s Piggies from the White Album) and the piggies find the crew a bunch of ultra truffles (cue Savoy Truffle on the pig hunt), so they become rich (cue Baby You’re A Rich Man). Finally the crew returns home to their mothers (Your Mother Should Know), but the song their mothers know ends up being Revolution 9.

The Beatles

I totally reorganized the White Album and separated disc 1 and disc 2 by theme, disc 1 being ballads and folk type songs and disc 2 being hard rock and R&amp;B type songs. I added When I’m Sixty-Four to disc 1 with the “granny music.” I added Polythene Pam and She Came In Through The Bathroom window to disc 2 (both were written in 1968), as well as Hey Bulldog, I Want You(She’s So Heavy), the single release of Revolution, and A Day In The Life.

Disc One

I start disc 1 with Honey Pie (iconic opening), Martha My Dear, and When I’m Sixty-Four, followed by Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-La (actually #4 on the White Album) and then Long, Long, Long (6 vs 3 but 12 letter titles (3,6,9,12) commas IDK), and Mother Nature’s Son and Julia (Mother Nature’s Son which drew inspiration from the same Maharishi speech that John’s Child Of Nature did, also Julia is about John’s mom, so yeah). Side 2 starts with The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill (great opening track in its title but also the guitar intro in the song itself). Followed by Rocky Raccoon and Piggies (BB (Bungalow Bill), RR (Rocky Raccoon), GG (Piggies)). Also the guitar intro of Rocky Raccoon matches that of Bungalow Bill and the honky tonky style piano at the end of Rocky Raccoon matches with the harpsichord in Piggies. Then I go with Blackbird because animals (raccoon, pig, bird) also there are animal noises in piggies and blackbird. Then after blackbird which is acoustic goodness I follow with Cry Baby Cry and Dear Prudence, which is a funny ending because usually you start a letter with Dear...

Side One 
1. Honey Pie

Disc Two

I start disc 2 with Polythene Pam (Prudence and Pam). Disc 2 is the no-no album for kids... it starts with Polythene Pam and She Came In Through The Bathroom Window (John/Paul), followed by Everybody’s Got Something To Hide Except For Me And My Monkey (really long titles), and then Why Don’t We Do It In The Road? which is also about monkeys (Paul saw monkeys doing it in India), and then Hey Bulldog because the piano is similar and then Sexy Sadie because piano and then end side 1 with While My Guitar Gently Weeps which is also piano yknow... Side 2 starts with Yer Blues (countdown intro) and then leads into I Want You(She’s So Heavy), Revolution, and Helter Skelter which all have similar openings and then Happiness Is A Warm Gun which eases into I’m So Tired and the finale A Day In The Life (John/Paul/John)

Let It Be/Get Back

I separated the sides Let It Be/Get Back by theme, so the first side is “Get Back” their jams and the second side is “Let It Be” or their ballad type stuff. I added The Ballad (haha) Of John And Yoko to the first side and Hey Jude to the second side. I also like the single version of Get Back more so I opened the album with it, followed by Two Of Us (originally starts the album) and For You Blue to make the opening three tracks (Paul, John, George). One After 909 follows with Ballad Of John And Yoko next because they start so jammy and side one closes with Dig A Pony and Maggie Mae due to a severe case of similar openings as well. Maggie Mae also closes side 1 of the original. 
Side 2 starts with Let It Be (both sides start with the title tracks) and continues with Don’t Let Me Down (Let It Be Let Me Down)(also the transition from the end of Let It Be to the beginning of Don’t Let Me Down is perfect), I Me Mine, I’ve Got A Feeling, The Long And Winding Road, Across The Universe (the long and winding road across the universe), and Hey Jude with the epic close.

Side One
1. Get Back (Single Version)
2. Two Of Us
3. For You Blue
4. One After 909
5. The Ballad Of John And Yoko

Yellow Submarine 

I replaced Hey Bulldog on Yellow Submarine with Lady Madonna (maybe a lady instead of the doggy in the movie?) and All You Need Is Love with Good Night (dreamy close?)(also Ringo’s Yellow Submarine and Ringo’s Good Night)(also all the Beatles films are Ringo centric to an extent u know).

Abbey Road

I Want You(She’s So Heavy), Polythene Pam, and She Came In Through The Bathroom Window are pretty hard to replace but I put in Glass Onion, You Know My Name(Look Up The Number), and Goodbye to Abbey Road.. First five songs are the same as the original but then I go Here Comes The Sun followed by Glass Onion which bridges into the classical elements of Because. The medley starts the same with You Never Give Me Your Money and Sun King but follows with You Know My Name(Look Up The Number) (Sun King which is slow eases into You Know My Name(Look Up The Number) which starts slow and is overall still slow)(also You Never Give and You Know My Name...). Then comes Mean Mr. Mustard (more like the esher demo to bridge Goodbye)(You Know My Name... it’s Mr. Mustard), Goodbye, Her Majesty, and then Carry That Weight and The End. 

Side One
1. Come Together
2. Something

In my alternative universe the crew split for a bit but then return soon after with a double LP of some old and more newer stuff (while maintaining solo careers)(and then they return to make one last album in the later seventies), also of course all the songs would sound different on an actual Beatles album (shorter songs and beautiful harmonies and such).

The Black Album Disc One

The Black Album (the double LP) disc 1 starts with Back In The U.S.S.R. (previously unreleased), Art Of Dying, and Hold On (Paul/John/George). Then goes Every Night, Old Brown Shoe and Maybe I’m Amazed (piano), and side 1 closes with What Is Life. Side 2 opens with I Found Out (great opening but also What Is Life? I Found Out.) and then comes Doctor Robert, Mrs. Vandebilt (The Dr and the Mrs), Letting Go, and Free As A Bird (you’re a free bird when you let go). Disc 1 closes with Isolation and Dear Friend (piano solo from John and Paul to close)(also Dear Prudence ends disc 1 of the White Album, Dear Friend ends disc 1 of the Black Album).

Disc Two

Disc 2 starts Oh My Love, Another Day, and I Live For You (John, Paul, George)(also coherent together (Oh My Love, Another Day, I Live For You)). Continues with another Paul/John piano with Tomorrow and Remember, then Single Pigeon and Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey as the close. Side 2 starts with The Ballad Of Sir Frankie Crisp(Let It Roll), which fits as an opener (let it roll) and matches the close of side 1 with Uncle Albert, Admiral Halsey, and then Sir Frankie. Then goes Crippled Inside (Crisp and Cripple), Junk (you feel like junk if you’re crippled inside), Mull Of Kintyre and Working Class Hero (similar sound maybe), and then Big Barn Bed and the closer Love (disc 2 opens with Oh My Love and closes with Love).

The Beatles Last Album 

The crew’s late seventies album is pretty much the theme of Band On The Run with songs like Cleanup Time, Not Guilty, (Just Like)Starting Over, Instant Karma!, and The Back Seat Of My Car (about freedom maybe but also like the backseat of a cop car) all being related to the opening track Band On The Run. So it starts with Band On The Run, Cleanup Time, and Bluebird (being free bird vibes)(blue cop?). Then goes Surprise Surprise(Sweet Bird Of Paradise)(surprise from blue cop makes you dream of paradise)(also birds). Then Not Guilty, JET (flying away), and LET Em In to close side 1. Side 2 begins with (Just Like)Starting Over (like starting over from the second side of the album)(also the opening chimes mirror the doorbell sequence at the start of Let Em In). Then John again with Instant Karma!, followed with The Back Seat Of My Car (piano on piano). Then Give Me Love(Give Me Peace On Earth) (u say that after being in a cop car), and then I Know(I Know), followed by Real Love (Give Me Real Love) and finally Nineteen Hundred And Eighty Five.

TheBeatles,qcdm4q,Koriqzia,1,Why is it that nobody talks about the Sexual Undertones of Polyethene Pam and She Came In Through the Bathroom Window?,"These songs make a lot more sense by reading them by what you hear rather than what the given lyrics are.

Polythene Pam Lyric Double Meanings:
She's the kind of a girl that makes the ""News of the World""

How it Sounds:
""She's the kind of a girl that makes them use at their will.""

The end of Polyethene Pam has a very sex like rhythm and vibe.

At the start of She Came In Through the Bathroom window you hear John say:
""He's cu-"" (cumming)

 And then Paul says
""She Came In thru the bathroom window.""

Which was extremely funny and creative to me the first time I realized what they did.

The Lines in She Came In Through the Bathroom window:
""But now she sucks her thumb and wanders""

Makes more sense as 
""But now she sucks at love and wonders.""

And the line:
""Well, I knew what I could not say""
Seems to serve as a reminder to let the ones who caught on to the double meaning that its true and they aren't just hearing things - that what they hear and how the given lyrics differ is 100% intentional.

And another line:
""And so I quit the police department""
makes more sense as
""And so I quit to Please Department""

Every other line in the song covers up the sexual innuendo of the whole thing.

And the ""protected by a silver spoon"" line is a great metaphor to mention how the true meaning of the song is covered up.

Take a listen, You'll hear it. Their tones of voice and the way the guitar speaks relates to the double meaning as well. I hope I'm not spoiling the joke for anybody, I noticed it while on acid and lots of people say to listen to abbey road while on acid...perhaps it's for these types of things you'll notice.

It's extremely strange I've never found anybody online comment on noticing this. Especially when the lyrics make more sense by how they sound rather than the ones that are given.",0,1634771492

In my opinion it makes me incredibly excited to see what/who else utilizes this technology to produce honestly a breathtaking experience. 
I think this album is a great example of what can be done. The pseudo-live sound with the ability to physically turn your head towards the sound of an instrument/vocalist is amazing. 
It genuinely can hold the vibes of watching music live, and the fact I can have even an ounce of that feeling with the Beatles is elating. 
“I’ve got a feeling” is my favorite example, the multiple vocals ringing out across the virtual stage with the of course amazing instrumental is an experience every fan should have. 
I would love to know everyone else with spatial audio availability’s opinion, and anyone who doesn’t have that available, I would like your opinion/thoughts on it too.

I like the idea of it being a studio album in the vein of “Please Please Me” - some editing/overdubs, but scaled back. I also really like the order of Glyn Johns’s version of “Get Back”. I did drop the jams / covers, and unfinished songs to make it a completely original songs album as well.

I kept/added in “I Me Mine” and “Across the Universe”. The hardest part was finding the right order for those two tracks.

Like, Lennon talks and acts like a writer would write him and an actor would be likely to play him. The way he says ""No!"" so abruptly to George feels like just out of a film trailer. 

And the dialogue feels very much like exposition and like they have taken the story of the Let It Be sessions and written a scrip that describes the issues and tensions very well. I kinda wonder if the voice over from Paul is from recent interviews. It really sounds like it, because things always change in hindsight.

Last night I watched yellow submarine with only audio and I imagined an entire movie in another style. Then it hit me. What if the Beatles fans came together with ideas and wrote their own fan made Yellow Submarine? A sort of reimagining if you will. Let me give you a few examples.
~
The blue meanies look like this.
The blue meanies that max and meanie chief are for lack of a better description ""The personality fusion of 60's tv joker with Tim Curry's Pennywise and a small dash of Razzmatazz."" They wear long multicolored stockings, 2 shades of Blue boots   and big blue fluffy coats. Some have letters or numbers on them.
~
The apple bonkers are these tall Victorian figures with blurred out faces. They are the tallest figures of the group.
~
The flying glove is an animated dare I say ""Alive"", glove. It should express emotions even if it's only anger.
~
Ringo's car is that of a 1920s Bentley inspired car. There is an illusion of the car getting bigger and Ringo staying the same size.
~
Jeremy is based on A quokka possibly.
~
The nowhere land is a ""Imagination void""
~
The yellow submarine works like a clock but the motor for the submarine is actually a moving model V8 engine.
~
When the yellow submarine is following Ringo we see that it sort of-- moves out of his vision. I'll have to storyboard it.
~
John's room where you meet him is actually a laboratory. Since the house seems to be some sort of multi portal gateway let's say that lab is actually a lab of giants. The Beatles and everything else is tini compared to the giant scientists. 
~



What I'm trying to say is this movie should be made by fans. It should be how they see it. It needs to have some sort of imaginary thing.

TheBeatles,q0arkx,Run-Like-A-Deer,1,Scary Magic,"I’m now 34 and on my third go round with the Beatles music.

Their music has just always been in my life but nobody I knew cared much about them.

Something special. I’ve always known. And I’ve always expected I would “get it” as I got older.

My question… or observation…
Why is their music kinda scary and hypnotic? Even as a kid I always thought their songs and especially vocals had a slightly unsettling affect. Combine that with all the weird, sometimes disturbing imagery, and we have something of an occult artifact in the Beatles.

So… they’re sorcerers or what?",6,1633235726

I enjoy liking things, I wish I could like everything, but some things suck and ""Here Comes the Sun"" is just annoying. It sounds like a song on an album called ""15 Great Songs for Kids."" It would be great right next to ""The Wheels on the Bus"" or ""The Itsy Bitsy Spider,"" but for adults? The way the lyrics talk down to you, try to get you to clap along, and the general feel good nature of the song is just childish and obnoxious. I'm not a downer, I like feel good or happy songs if they don't feel forced or don't sound ugly but both those things are true of ""Here Comes the Sun.""

Here are some Beatle songs I enjoy: ""Hey Jude,"" ""Let It Be,"" and ""Octopus Garden."" So it's not as if I hate The Beatles band or some of their happy sounding or less dense stuff, but this particular song rubs me the wrong way. It feels particularly condescending. My annoyance is amplified by the popularity and praise the song gets. Some things I've heard are how great the song is because it's ""still relevant after all these years."" Seriously? It's a song about good times coming back after bad times. Is the fact such vague lyrical content holds up really of note? Songs about emotions will always be relevant, ""You Had a Bad Day"" will still be relevant in 100 years, so how is that anything special? 

Maybe I'm just a Grinch, but the song is just trash to me. Any Beatles fans feel the same way? It would feel good to hear some Beatles fans back up some of my thoughts here.",8,1632182318

I probably have more than 20 Beatle songs in my library(Something is my favourite, idk if that tells anything) from their entire discography; But I'm looking to get deeper.

As I said, I probably know all their ""major"" hits, and I've heard Rubber Soul years ago, and some deep-cut songs from that I love to this day, but I have never revisited that record since.

I'm mostly an alt. rock guy, my favourites are Radiohead, Arctic Monkeys, KGLW, the list is endless. And my question is, what record do you think I should start with? 

I could just go chronologically from Please Please Me to Let It Be, but I know there are better ways to experience it for the first time.

Aside from having the most honest perspective possible on their catalog, how he’s chosen to take the ambience that’s already there and make it the environment you’re in is fucking brilliant. 

All of the other (well, a lot of them) spatial remixes I’ve heard are gimmicky and just feels like someone hard panned things all over the place. The Beatles stuff is theatrical, orchestral and enveloping even during the most simple of arrangements. 

Had such a blast listening to Sgt Pepper and Let it be on Apple Music last night. 

If you have a pair of AirPods, put spatial on and check it out - although I would recommend turning off the “head tracking” feature. It seems cool for movies but very disorienting for audio.

TheBeatles,pio41c,Alex_Cavern,1,Here's a thing for all the musicians here!," **Come One, Come Paul**

This band is currently looking for somebody who’d like to fill a Paul McCartney-esque role in the group. This isn’t a position solely for McCartney impersonators; and is open to anybody providing they fill some of, if not all, the requirements listed below. Requirements that are bolded are musts; non-bolded requirements are more so heavily suggested abilities. 

The requirements are as follows:

**You must be able to play bass, guitar, and piano while singing.**  
 You must live in either Canada or the United States.  
 **You must be willing to travel for recording or live gigs (of which I assume there won’t be many)**  
 **You must have a similar singing style to Paul.**  
 **You must have a similar range to some degree (Paul’s range is G2-B5; but you don’t have to be spot on.** **just roughly around there.**  
 **You must write original music (or you must be willing to help with writing songs).**

If you’re interested; please submit a 3 audition files; one of you playing bass and singing, one of you playing guitar and singing, and one of you playing piano and singing. If you don’t have access to a piano, or one of the other following instruments; then feel free to skip that file.

Please submit your auditions to: [beatbackauditions@outlook.com](mailto:beatbackauditions@outlook.com)

So I want to get into real opinions, which is that track which have a bigger appeal, but it's not everyone first thought?

Here's the top 3 tracks for each album, so you can't choose them: [\[source\]](https://chartmasters.org/2018/11/streaming-masters-the-beatles/) 

**Please Please Me:** Twist and Shout, Love Me Do, I Saw Her Standing There

**With the Beatles:** All My Loving, Till There Was You, Roll Over Beethoven

**A Hard Day's Night:** A Hard Day's Night, Can't Buy Me Love, And I Love Her

**Beatles for Sale:** Eight Days a Week, I'll Follow the Sun, No Reply

**Help!:** Yesterday, Help, Ticket to Ride

**Rubber Soul:** In My Life, Norwegian Wood, Michelle

**Revolver:** Eleanor Rigby, Yellow Submarine, For No One

**Sgt. Pepper's:** Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, Sgt. Pepper's, A Day in the Life

**Magical Mystery Tour:** All You Need is Love, Penny Lane, Strawberry Fields Forever

**White Album:** Blackbird, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Ob-la di, Ob-la da

**Yellow Submarine:** Hey Bulldog, All Together Now, Only a Northern Song (Only  4 new + B-Side included)

**Abbey Road:** Here Comes the Sun, Come Together, Something

**Let it Be:** Let it Be, Get Back, Across the Universe

&amp;#x200B;

My takes:

**Please Please Me:** Please Please Me. Easy take for me, I thought this one and DYWTKAS would be more popular than I Saw Her Standing There.

**With the Beatles:** It Won't be Long. Wow, I'm impressed this one and Hold Me Tight got surpassed. I was only expecting All My Loving.

**A Hard Day's Night:** I Should Have Known Better. Ooh, trick one. For me, most AHDN tracks have the same feel, so I'm choosing this one as it's very popular in my country (mostly because of a cover).

**Beatles for Sale:** Every Little Thing. Only because it's an original. Impressed Rock and Roll Music didn't make it.

**Help!:** You've Got to Hide Your Love Away. Ooh, another trick one. This one and You're Going to Lose that Girl has very similar vibes to me, honestly I could choose either.

**Rubber Soul:** Girl. Another one where my favorite ones were chosen, but Girl really stands out.

**Revolver:** Tomorrow Never Knows. Taxman would have been a close call.

**Sgt. Pepper's:** Lovely Rita. I really enjoy it, not much to say.

**Magical Mystery Tour:** I am the Walrus. It's hard to beat those B-Side songs in popularity. Still, the title track, Fool on the Hill and Blue Jay Way were close calls.

**White Album:** Back in the U.S.S.R. Perhaps White Album should have been separate in two, one for each disc. First time I'm choosing my actual favorite song from the album.

**Yellow Submarine:** It's All Too Much. It's the only available option ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

**Abbey Road:** Octopus's Garden. Lots to choose from.

**Let it Be:** The Long and Winding Road. Some controversial opinions on this one, but I guess it's the one which fits better the 4th place.",6,1630623664

TheBeatles,pgl01n,NowhereMan6207,1,Beatles For Sale. A good or lazy album?,"After my first post about Revolver, and it getting tons of comments and upvotes for my first ever Reddit post, I decided to make another for fun! Now, today we will be discussing ""Beatles For Sale"". And before you read the rest of this, let me tell you that I actually enjoyed this album, so if that upsets you, you are very welcome to comment your opinion! I love reading and responding to comments, so make sure you do! Alrighty, one thing I'd like to point out is that their were (from what I gathered) quite a few covers! But each cover sounded great to me! Especially Mr. Moonlight. Mr. Moonlight was a really fun, creative song, but definitely not as good as other songs on the album. Also, this was made at the HEIGHT of Beatlemania. They would've already released A Hard Day's Night, which just added to their popularity, plus they were under a lot of pressure from the record companies to create a great album, so that probably added to the ""lazy mood"" from the album. But for some reason, after listening to this, I actually thought it was great! Not as good as Rubber Soul or Let It Be, but definitely better than Magical Mystery Tour, and Yellow Submarine. You have awesome songs on here, like I Don't Want To Spoil The Party, I'm A Loser, No Reply, and of course, Eight Days A Week. Now, I know I'll probably start a huge debate since I'm defending this album, so I'll leave the rest up to you, and you can comment your thoughts! So, final question: Beatles For Sale. A good album, or lazy album?",12,1630599135

I've only been a Beatles fan for about a year, so I'm a newborn to this stuff, but after looking at the view count on YouTube and asking different fans their favorite songs, and listening to Revolver for about ten times, I've concluded that it is the most underrated album. You have incredible songs first of all. Taxman, Elanor Rigby, Yellow Submarine, I'm Only Sleeping, Here There and Everywhere, Good Day Sunshine, and Tomorrow Never Knows JUST TO NAME A FEW! Out of every Beatles fan that I've talked to, they never really mention songs from this album, or even the album at all! But we also need to take into consideration that this album completely changed rock music, and created Psychedelic Music with Tomorrow Never Knows (at least from the research I've done).

It is most similar to ""Love"" and ""Anthology 3"" versions though it lacks the orchestral backing of ""Love"" and his voice has a much ""cleaner"" tone to it than in the ""Anthology 3"" version. I'm not sure if ""cleaner"" is the right word but it sound more natural, perhaps less produced.

I heard it many years ago when my music collection was quite a bit largely, only more recently hearing it in a video on Dailymotion.com which seems to have been since taken down. In researching versions of the songs I have found no reference to acoustic versions mentioned above. If I recall correctly there is an almost wailing at the end of the track, a sort of ""woahoahoah"". On a final note, it did not *sound* like it was a live version.

The way we did it was I would post a poll containing all the songs on one side of one album (Reddit's polls only lets you include six options), then we'd find a winner and move on to the next side. That means that each album has two ""survivor winners""

It was a great way to talk about the albums, and it was fun to hear people's thoughts.

Anyway, if you want to see what survivor polls are like, visit my page, and scroll down a little. :)

We'd start with Please Please Me side 1, then side 2, then with the Beatles side 1, then with the Beatles side 2, then some non-album singles, and we'd continue that way. :)

Anyone else have this set too? A dear friend works at a local buy sell trade shop for media and other things, who called me up and told me to come by. I knew it must have been something special, when he didn't even tell me what it was. Either that, or he was just too busy to do so. I tried to convince myself that it was too much money for about 24 hours, before I finally realized that I would end up kicking myself if I didn't try to take it home. I went through the contents carefully tje following day, saw the entire set is pretty much near mint, then went and took out 820 usd from the bank, and brought it home. Is actually quite a deal, if you see what others are selling for in similar condition, and that I have never seen another before or since. The sales history is so wonky, due to many selling pieces of the set. I have no regrets

TheBeatles,pbriiw,FindingFretless,1,Bartell Fretless - The Beatles rarest guitar?,"www.findingfretless.com

The remarkable story of George Harrison’s prototype ‘mad’ guitar and the search for Jimi Hendrix’s and Frank Zappa’s.

“Paul has done an amazing bit of detective work for Finding Fretless, it would put Poirot to shame.” Fiona Bruce – BBC Antiques Roadshow.

“This is an incredibly rare Beatles guitar with an enviable history, which turns out to be one of the most valuable items ever seen … valued at £300,000 – £400,000 by Jon Baddeley”.

Finding Fretless tells the remarkable tale of the discovery and rich history of an invaluable late-1960s fretless electric guitar, one fondly remembered by George Harrison as the ‘Mad’ guitar.

The prototype fretless model was gifted to the Beatles legend by Hollywood session player and music shop owner Al Casey, whose wife Maxine took it to Blue Jay Way in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles while Harrison was staying there in 1967.

Returning to the UK with his new acquisition, it was used by Harrison and John Lennon on sessions for ‘Happiness is a Warm Gun’ and ‘Helter Skelter’ as the legendary Liverpool outfit recorded classic 1968 double-album The Beatles, aka The White Album.

Guitar experts and aficionados were previously unaware of the prototype’s important part in Beatles mythology, its history a mystery until 2019, after UK session guitarist Ray Russell asked, ‘Who knows anything about this guitar George Harrison gave me in 1985?’.

Finding Fretless sees author Paul Brett amend the history books, piecing together the jigsaw to tell the full story of the prototype Bartell alongside that of one of the forgotten founding fathers of the electric guitar, master luthier Paul Barth.

Within, Brett’s extensive research is supported by leading academics and established authors and personal memories of top session players who worked with the likes of Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley and The Beach Boys, Finding Fretless including forewords from two highly-regarded guitarists intrinsically linked to the tale – London session player, producer and composer Ray Russell, and American producer, sideman and session player Richard Bennett.

In a compelling story, Brett also shines light on the incredible history of Bartell and a seminal period in California that influenced musicians on both sides of the Atlantic.

Finding Fretless also brings in the guitar’s associations with Charles Manson’s infamous murderous cult, a million-dollar lawsuit, fire, frying pans, drunken fistfights, corporate shenanigans, Elvis, The Wrecking Crew, and much more.

And those interviewed include descendants of Bartell company presidents and surviving employees, Brett also revealing previously-untold memories of some of the most influential creators in the development of the electric guitar, including Barth, Beauchamp, Rickenbacker, Fender, and the Dopyera brothers.",0,1629949417

Showcasing many further treasures from Paul’s archive, The Lyrics includes handwritten lyric sheets, unseen personal photographs, drafts, and drawings. Each song is accompanied by a commentary by Paul McCartney giving a unique insight into his creative process.

To accompany the new book, the British Library has announced it will host a free display entitled Paul McCartney: The Lyrics (5 November 2021 – 13 March 2022), which will celebrate the songwriter and performer and feature previously unseen lyrics from his personal archive.

TheBeatles,p6fkm7,Humboldt_,1,Your ideal Beatles album,"Recently I was thinking about what the ideal Beatles album would look like - if you could pick any of the songs from the Beatles' discography and put them into one album what would it look like? The total length of the album must be under 46 minutes (the duration of two sides of a 12-inch record).

These are my picks:

SIDE A (22:30)

1. Here Comes The Sun
2. You've Got To Hide Your Love Away
3. I've Just Seen A Face
4. Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)
5. In My Life
6. Nowhere Man
7. For No One
8. Eleanor Rigby
9. Got To Get You Into My Life
10. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)

SIDE B (22:46)

1. Help!
2. She Loves You
3. All My Loving
4. I Feel Fine
5. Day Tripper
6. We Can Work It Out
7. Your Mother Should Know

TheBeatles,p2uf9b,mceleanor,1,Making the perfect version of Please Please Me,"I love Please Please Me, but they were new to songwriting and they didn't have time for complicated arrangements on the album. So, I took my favorite tracks from WTB, and some contemporaneous singles, and made a perfect debut album. Let me know what you think!

Side 1

1. I Saw Her Standing There (perfect opener, wouldn't change it, Paul showcase)

2. ~~Misery~~ Don't Bother Me (both have similar themes, but I like Don't Bother Me more, plus it's a George showcase)

3. Anna (it's a cover, but I love it, and John sounds great.)

4. ~~Chains~~ You Really Got A Hold On Me (similar subject, I think YRGAHOM is a better cover. Hold Me Tight also could have worked here.)

5. Boys (great Ringo song)

6. ~~ask me why~~ She Loves You (I don't really like this B-side, so I replaced it with another single)

7. ~~please please me~~ I Want To Hold You Hand (I don't really like this A-side, so I replaced it with another single)

Side 2

1. Love Me Do (great song!)

2. ~~ps I love you~~ All My Loving (they're both about writing a love note, but AML is the better song.)

3. Baby It's You (I love this cover)

4. ~~Do You Want To Know A Secret~~ It Won't Be Long (replace a boring song with a barn burner)

5. ~~a taste of honey~~ Til There Was You (they have a similar feel, but TTWY isn't a waste of money)

6. There's A Place (perfect penultimate song)

7. Twist and Shout (John's ragged vocals have to close out the album.) :)",5,1628750609

...my father who is a self-employed carpenter &amp; joiner was once given a job to sort out someone’s kitchen, you know like, completely redo it. He arrived at the house which was a large sort of estate (I think that’s what he called it) and the person there showed him where he’d be working and all the odds and ends of it all.

After my dad had been there for about a week he was told the owner would pop by to give his opinions on woods and colours etc... so my dad not having any clue who lived there was one day sweeping sawdust up when a bloke entered the room and shook his hand, admiring the handy work my dad had so far completed. My dad told me he didn’t react and says he played it really cool not asking for a signature or what have you. Anyway, the chap was George Harrison. A top bloke my dad says. 

Some weeks later a man broke into that very house and stabbed Mr Harrison straight through the chest. 
He survived to live a little longer. 

My dad didn’t tell me that story like he was bursting at the seems to tell anyone, even though he’s a huge fan. He just one day told me whilst driving his van and that old tune came on, Here comes the Sun.

I remember racing home to borrow the money off Mum. It wasn’t my first Beatles album but it was the first that showed something different to the EMI albums and songs I’d know since I was a seven year old living in Lancashire (Somewhere near Liverpool).

I’ve got the album playing now. Well sort of: I’m listening to my phone which has in order (Alphabetical – the way I listen to music these days) – Ain’t She Sweet, Cry For A Shadow, Nobody;s Child, Sweet Georgia Brown and My Bonnie. I’m up to My Bonnie now. Brian Sheridan singing most songs a’la Elvis. Great stuff the Beatles a backing band except for the Cry for a Shadow a Lennon Harrison==son  instrumental a’la Shadows and Lennon ripping out Ain;t She Sweet. It’s just started playing through again “Ain’t She Sweet” Very Music Hall but Electric. Cry for a Shadow the first time I ever heard George’s lead for a full song. Nobody’s Child no-one liked it, to slow and sloppy. But Harrison redid it years later with the Wilbury’s.

I suppose it was the day I realised commercial music wasn’t everything. Ruby Baby just came on, I missed that in the list. It’s like Elvis would have done it. It was 8 years later before I next heard Elvis taken off so well, That was Robert Gordon on his Fresh Fish Special album.

Anyway these were the days when I went to school (Springvale High) and worked at Woolworths for 13 hrs a week.

I love that change from Music Hall to Rock and Roll in My Bonnie – a song that you’d read was the song that introduced Brian Epstein to the Beatles. Read about but never before heard.

I guess that was a day in my life.

TheBeatles,oo5moh,Zeenaut,1,"A short love letter to Revolution 9 (and the White Album, as a whole).","Personally I love Revolution 9. Not many other bands at the time, perhaps maybe The Velvet Underground (who I also love), would have created such an interesting piece. Many see it as simply a ""bad song"" but truly it isn't a song at all. I feel it's more of just an interesting crack at trying to be experimental via a sound collage. I just find it to be very cool, especially for something like that to be made at such an early period. I can understand the ""Number Nine"" part tends to loose it's charm after a short time bit I still find it to be neat. 

White Album is one of my favorites because it a complete mix bag. Similar to Let It Be, none of the songs really bleed or meld into one another quite like they might on Sgt. Pepper's or Abbey Road. I love how you have a song like Rocky Raccoon on the same album as Helter Skelter. Don't get me wrong, I love medly's as well, but this complete mixed bag of song ideas presented on White Album strikes me as so interesting. This album at certain points is arguably the most experimental, abrasive, and somber project that the Beatles ever put out, and what did they make the cover? All white with just their name. Funny, huh? 

But anyway, Revolution 9 to be reads as everything the White Album stands for. It is the epitome of the Beatles' craziest ideas, yet you can absolutely tell it is John's baby, as he was always interested in the more artsy, thought-provoking side of the music world (and I'm sure Yoko influenced him even more as she herself had dabbled in weirder genres such as noise and avant garde). Yes, there are certain points where the collage can be a sonic catastrophe, but that's what makes it so appealing. The idea of it is pretty fascinating. Also, you have to admit, the piano piece buried within is beautiful. 

Is the White Album my favorite? Not sure, possibly. Is it their most influential album? Probably not, I think Revolver holds that title. I love the songs on White Album, but more than that I love the idea of it.",21,1626798875

TheBeatles,oj3wya,iancnasc,1,'The Beatles: George Lead-Vocals.' - A Spotify Playlist.,"A bit over four months ago I made a playlist on Spotify featuring every song from The Beatles discography sung by George Harrison, as an homage for his birthday. I guess because I made very similar posts for same-type playlists for the other members of the band, a bot from another Beatles subreddit, I realized, considered the post to be spam. Well, it isn't, so here's a repost.

The songs are presented in chronological order, and non-album singles are included.

I noticed a lot of people appreciated these playlists, so I'd like to say I'm glad to have put in the time to make them. And thanks for following, guys. Any suggested change can be made. Hope you all like this last one.

PS: As I touched on above, there are similar playlists for John, Paul and Ringo, all of which can be found in my Spotify profile.

Cheers!

TheBeatles,ohthcu,Marcospalonso,1,We nearly had another Beatles' album during the 90's,"I was curious about the making of ""Free as a Bird"" and ""Real Love"" and I found [this article](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-11-18-ca-4428-story.html) in which Jeff Lyne (producer of these singles) said that Paul, George and Ringo had a little talk about doing a whole new album, but discarded because time didn't permit it.

Why is this the first time that I'm hearing about this? For me it seems like something that is not often talked about among Beatles sites. I know that in the end nothing happened but I have never seen videos or theories about this and I found it pretty interesting.

As for how the album would have been, I can't just fathom how that would have gone. It surely would have been an extremely different album because of John not being there and the near 30 years gap since the Beatles separation and the corresponding evolution of them as individuals and musicians, but wow. 

I don't know about you people but I found this piece of information pretty interesting and I think it might not be of common knowledge and wanted to share it :)

&gt;We earned millions and millions. The Beatles got very little of it. We've all got houses, we've managed to pay for them finally after all these years, and that only happened since Klein came in. They used to tell Paul and I that we were millionaires. We never have been. We didn't get the money. George and Ringo are practically penniless.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- John

Allan Steckler also contributed with this:

&gt;He took their Capitol contract, thew it out the window and renegotiated a new one. I think they were then making 17.5% a record and he upped it to over 40% in average. It was a huge increase. The highest royalty any artist had ever received. He got Apple Films 50% instead of 20% of gross from United Artists. He also got them a huge chunk of money they were owd in back payments, and total control and ownership of their product in North America while managed by ABKCO.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Allan Steckler

I'm going to conclude with this other quote by him:

&gt;Despite all the crap that was said about Allen, and some of it was true, he had a very strong, positive feeling about John &amp; Yoko. He really loved them and completely turned their fortunes around.

I think its evolution from the March ‘63 version is amazing, and stands as a metaphor for the Beatles’ own evolution, both individually and as a group. 

I love the fact that John likely wrote the bulk of it in the late 50s, with he and Paul finishing it soon after their meeting in Summer ‘57… and we get to hear it at what is nearly the end point. 
 
The whaling, train-horn opening. Ringo’s relentless train track, huff-puff, open hi-hat beat. Billy Preston’s spirited and, as always, perfectly-crafted accompaniment. John and Paul harmonising once again. George’s ”drolly mixing of Perkins and Clapton” in his pattering of riffs and a beautifully-crafted solo on _that_ rosewood Telecaster.

History and chemistry underpin the whole song, and you can really hear their enjoyment in playing together as a group, like they used to.",4,1625044038

TheBeatles,o73dbf,monolog21,1,An Allegation Against McCartney (dumbfounded on this),"
Point of the post: Please help me figure out if it's true. There was a post that claimed that Paul had engaged in sexual acts with minors. Their source, an ex-investigative journalist who became their tutor, told them in class. In the 80s, a London rent boy had incriminating photos of Jimmy Saville with minors. The tutor saw them, paid for copies, but the rent boy ran off with the money. During this exchange the rent boy had also claimed of having incriminating photos of Paul engaging in said crime. The post doesn't mentioned whether the tutor saw the photos too.

The tutor along the way befriended Paul's former wife Heather Mills, who had told him that she was divorcing Paul because of his pedophilic behavior. This became a reoccurring conversation when he helped her with the divorce as a friend. The guy who posted found an article of Mills during the time of the divorce where she said she had a box of evidence that will reveal the truth. The guy inferred Mill's statements in the article to be referring to Paul's pedophilia.

Reference to the post : /r/conspiracy/comments/hlzowe/sir_paul_mccartney_please_read_this/

Reference to the article: https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/ive-had-worse-press-than-a-pedophile-mills-mccartney-20071101-gdrhk1.html

Now why I think it isn't true: 1. Saville's thing had been rumored for decades, the rent boy might be pulling his leg to get more money; 2. Heather Mills is known to be a habitual liar as stated by people in her personal life, and also may be erratic and bitter during the divorce.

I founded the post while searching for posts about the song ""This One"". I've spent 7 hours on this topic. Now, I don't know the subreddit where the post came from that much, so it might be just bullshit for all I know. But the way the post is written so thorough made me undecided, and so I made an account just to find some answers to this. I hope it's not true, the first song I mastered on the piano was Martha My Dear. Please help me put my mind at ease.",7,1624549019

TheBeatles,o6j4gg,SynthFrenetic,1,Are younger fans having different tastes about The Beatles?,"&gt;*The children of the 2000s, of the next century, will be listening to The Beatles -* Brian Epstein, Beatles Manager, 1964

I have been thinking on writing this for a GOOOOOD while, but whenever I see someone new saying they got to their first go through Beatles stuff, my interest on this subject sparkles.

The principle is simple: The Beatles are a timeless band for sure, but are younger people liking them differently?

This might sound funny at first, but I do feel people's taste across Beatles' related Subreddits are changing from what they were 20 or so years ago.

For example, I kinda grew up hearing that Sgt. Pepper's and Abbey Road were two of the best albums ever made, and while this statement is still true, I'm seeing more and more newcomers saying on how mind-blowing Revolver and White Album are than the others, and while acknowledging the importance of the other two, these are being more and more ranked on lower positions.

I think a clear example of this is how Sgt. Pepper's moved from being THE best album of all time according to the Rolling Stone in 2003 and now occupying, in my opinion, a shameful 24th position the album definitely does not deserve in 2020.  It still ranks lower to Abbey Road and Revolver, respectively.

Another example I think I can mention is regarding the 50 years deluxe editions, starting with Pepper, than White and Abbey Road with a rumored Let it Be edition. Still, no Revolver, which I have seen people chanting and showing how people's tastes are changing, where they either thought it wasn't profitable or don't even had the idea of doing it.

I don't know, I feel it might be a bit too early to debate something like this, especially with most of us being, at least, a 3rd generation of Beatlemaniacs. And of course, this let me wondering, will my children and grandchildren, if Beatlemanics, enjoy the same albums as I do? If Revolver seems it's just getting understood 55 years since its release, will the next generations relate with another one? 

My bet really goes on Rubber Soul, since for me, it was when Beatles really showed up they were not just another boy band,  but actually very versatile, so without it there was no Revolver, Pepper, White or Abbey Road.

Which are your thoughts? Are people starting to relate more with 50+ years albums and find meanings in something not relatable at the time? Are we starting to bring 'new Beatles classics, originally overlooked tracks which are just now being appreciated? Will this scenario change a lot in the next few years?

Last but not least, I think we may this will be the first generation where we can say like ""My dad/grandad was vibing with this when he was my age"" So perhaps some kind of nostalgia/historic meaning to the tracks regarding the first albums?",11,1624473637

TheBeatles,o4fsw8,TunaPounder,1,I have been on a Beatles journey having never heard their music 4 months ago. I just finished Abbey Road.,"So this might be a long one and no one might see it but I had to get this off my chest. Even if I can't post lol.

 I'd heard Here Comes The Sun, Hey Jude and Yellow Submarine. But as everyone knows, The Beatles are ubiquitous. As I've discovered listening to their music these past few months, it is and always has been everywhere, I'm just so glad I never payed attention. 

Through 2020 I dealt with the lockdown by diving into music, I consumed tons of albums and eventually started going through some 'classics'. So naturally I decided that to consider myself a huge fan of music, I had to listen to The Beatles.

 I started where it began really, Please Please Me, and immediately I felt enraptured. Something about that mono mix just sounded *great* so yeah, one song, one second in. I became a Beatlemaniac. 

Every. Song. Was. Good. 

They were great, and I was just at the start. I thought 'yes wow, I get it, sure they're a kind of pop-y poncey boy band but these songs are catchy!'

I spent my time with each album to really take them in and I came to the same conclusion every time. 

Every. Song. Is. Good.

I was enjoying the music so much that I had to dive into the history of the Band, scouring through interviews that coincided with the album/singles I was listening to, reading about studio sessions and Lennons increasingly comic cynicism when recalling tunes. 

I fell in love with them all. 

Then I got to Revolver.

At this point I felt like every song was written for me. I can't describe it any other way. I love this Album. I was stuck on it for a while. At times when I was low it could pick me up, or make me dwell on things more, it made me *think*. It made me cry. It made laugh because oh my fucking god like *WHAT* how do you take a masterpiece like Revolver and then *drop in* Ringo Starr wistfully singing a magical whimsical tune about a fuckin YELLOW SUBMARINE and manage to pull it off??

Because they did pull it off. I love that god damn song.



 I think I was starting to get it. 

The Beatles are my favourite band. That's the opinion I'd like to share with you today. 

Of course I continued listening after Revolver, and of course I loved Sgt Pepper.

Of course I loved The White Album.

By now I had spent months investing in this band with a monolithic discography;  a cornerstone of pop culture, of music in general. 

But it was coming to an end. 

I don't feel I have to mention Let It Be or Abbey Road, I bet it's been done more times than i can count. I bet nothing I've said is a new opinion. But for these past 4 months it was all new for me.

I fell in love with a 60s boy group with mop tops. Laughed at their cheeky interviews and picked my favourites. I watched them grow into music giants. I grieved for them. 


To the four lads from Liverpool, good stuff 👍.

I've uploaded the song via unlisted. The song played on VLC shows this cd image on it but could not find anything on google images. Theres no meta data on the file that should give any reason why it has this image on VLC.

19 years ago I was on a social media site before myspace days and found a profile with this nice soothing song of across the universe. I believe I found it around 2002-2003ish. No later than 2004.  
I proceeded to download it via the HTML script. There was no info on the song except for the file name ""across the universe.mp3"".

Every now and then I try to find out using phone apps like sound hound and shazam and NOTHING. I've asked a few friends. Nothing.  You guys are my last hope. I have a feeling it may be a local band but maybe someone has heard of it. Thank you for all your help!",2,1624076877

TheBeatles,nsmpxg,Out_In_The_Tiles,1,"The History Behind The Tracks - ""Revolution 9""","""Revolution 9"" was never meant to be composed in a conventional way (aside from the brief extract of Paul playing the piano at the beginning). The track is a collage of sounds produced by the manipulation of audio they were recording at the time and newly found audio. In 1990, George Martin stated that ""it wasn't music, but it was a sound picture."" 

Experimentation with tape in 1968 was not particularly a new thing, at least for The Beatles.

&gt;I had two Brenell tape recorders hooked up. And there were all these electronic composers you were listening to for a break from our own style of music.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Paul

Paul was inspired by the work of artists such as Luciano Berio and discovered sound loops, he soon learned how to effectuate them on tape.

&gt;I could make some very strange noises and so late at night you would say, ""Listen to this!"" It was just sort of far-out music, really. It had turned John on so he got two Brenells and I set all that up for him at his house.  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Paul

""Tomorrow Never Knows"" was a track featuring a live mix of homemade tape loops playing all around from machines at the EMI Recording Studios. About two years later, ""I Am The Walrus"" featured random snatches of dialogue faded in and out from a BBC radio broadcast. Those tracks were a fusion between pop and avant-garde -- adventurous stuff at the time -- but ""Revolution 9"" took that to another level. For most listeners, ""Revolution 9"" was their first contact with musique concréte.

""Revolution 9"" was masterminded by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Lennon's new partner at the time.

&gt;It was somewhat under her influence. Once I heard her stuff -- not just the screeching and the howling, but her word pieces and talking and breathing and all this strange stuff, I got intrigued. I wanted to do one.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- John

Just a week later after *The Beatles* was released in the UK, the duo released *Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins.* This LP was recorded at John's house in real-time. That album is noises on tape, synthesis of dialogue, and music.

Although Paul was interested in the contemporary avant-garde scene of the time, he had no involvement in the creation of The Beatles' lengthiest track. When the track was finished, it aroused opinions on whether it should be credited to The Beatles.

&gt;We created Apple just for that. I had some stuff I could have done too. I remember once saying to John I was going to do an album called *Paul McCartney Goes Too Far.* He was really tickled with that idea. He said, ""That's great. You really should do it."" I would calculate and think, ""No, I'd better do 'Hey Jude', you know.""",0,1622864089

They decide to call it “A Doll’s House” which was the original name idea for “The White Album” so let’s begin, and for the first and only time ever Harrison has equal songwriting status with Lennon and McCartney

A Doll’s House (1969)

All tracks are credited to Lennon-McCartney, except where noted:

Side A:
1. Child Of Nature
2. Only A Northern Song (Harrison)
3. All Together Now 
4. Hey Bulldog 
5. It’s All Too Much (Harrison)
6. Circles (Harrison)

Side B:
7. Junk 
8. What’s The New Mary Jane
9. Sour Milk Sea (Harrison)
10. Step Inside Love
11. Not Guilty (Harrison)
12. Across The Universe

TheBeatles,no0o5v,MeetTheIntrovert4,1,When would The Beatles have reunited?,"Although The Beatles never reunited, although Paul, George and Ringo reunited as a trio in 90s for the Anthology project. It doesn’t count as a proper reunion without John Lennon. But if John had lived pass 1980, when would they have reformed?

People would always say they might have reunited for Live Aid in 1985, I don’t think they would have, as George still hadn’t made up with the Lennon-McCartney duo by the time John died. If George and John agreed to do it, rehearsals might have not went well, and John might have wanted to bring Yoko with him onstage, resulting possibly George backing out the last minute. Because we all know George hates Yoko. Paul and George tho? They were still at each other’s throats even when the Anthology came around, George only did it because he needed the money. 

But I could see the Lennon-McCartney duo reuniting by 1984 and releasing an LP together, like how Jimmy Page and Robert Plant reunited years after Led Zeppelin spilt. To promote it I could see them doing Live Aid as a duo, not a reunion with the other 2. I think they would have performed at JFK instead. They might have played Let It Be, John singing Imagine, performing Come Together, I Saw Her Standing There, I Wanna Hold Your Hand, If I Fell and We Can Work It Out. 

I don’t see them reuniting to perform at big venues, in front of thousands of people, they might have done another rooftop concert, or maybe a reunion show at Bramley Moore Dock at their hometown Liverpool. Or maybe just playing scattered shows at The Carven Club. 

So I could see them getting back together maybe in 1987, they reunite to perform Love Me Do on “Top Of The Pops” to celebrate it’s 25th anniversary of it’s release. That might have gotten the Anthology project to start 6 years earlier in 1988, they announce the project when they got inducted in the RNR Hall Of Fame, but instead of using scrapped Lennon demos, they just record unreleased songs and maybe make 4 new songs that never existed in this timeline. They spent the next 2 years working together before going back to their solo projects by 1990, and reunite again in 1994 for a big tour to celebrate their 30th anniversary of appearing on Ed Sullivan, I know I said before they might have not performed in front of big venues in front of big audiences but it was only John, George and Ringo that didn’t want to tour again, Paul might have talked them into it because by then the technology would be more advanced in the 90s? Who knows? Sadly we’ll never know if they would have gotten back together.",6,1622337859

TheBeatles,nnhi6a,MeetTheIntrovert4,1,Beatles biopic idea and fancasting:,"So if i were asked to direct a Beatles biopic, it would take place from the 1st gig with Ringo in August 1962, and ends with their last recording session together on August 1969, recording “The End” The movie could be called “A Day In The Life” with the T in “The” being the dropped T logo. 

Who would i cast:
For John Lennon, i decided instead of finding an actor to play him, i decided to have a guy who plays him in a tribute band to do the role, and that guy is Adam Hastings, who performed as him in the tribute band “The Fab Four” and “The Bootleg Beatles” search up a picture of him and you’ll know why i chose him.

For Paul McCartney, people always say Tom Holland looks like him, but i would go with Craig Roberts. 

For George Harrison, the first person fans think could play him in a biopic is Timothée Chalamet, but Timothée is American and I’ve seen Justin Long try to do the Liverpudlian accent in Walk Hard and it was kinda bad IMO, so i would choose the lead actor of my favorite show, The Good Doctor, Freddie Highmore, to play him. You might not agree at first, but seeing pictures of the 2 side by side and you might start to agree.

Finally, for Ringo Starr, Tom Dunlea from Cilla. If you don’t know what Cilla is, it’s a 3 episode miniseries about the real Beatles friend Cilla Black.

From the leather jackets and jeans of Hamburg to the floral psychedelia of their waning days, there are surely fans and detractors of each stylistic transmutation. Personally, I struggle with this. I am the biggest fan of their early music sonically but I find that them dressing like complete faggots during that period kind of sours me on the whole thing. What say you?",7,1622220048

TheBeatles,nizo7r,Out_In_The_Tiles,1,"Mini-fragments of the John &amp; Yoko interview at the NOW First International Planning Conference, 3 June 1973:","**Yoko**: I'm here because I'm a woman and I'm very interested to meet other sisters. Meeting is very important and exciting;  it's better than writing down words. I get a lot out of it. Women are very powerful, they have immense power hidden in them. They had to hide it in this society because of the male society. They were taught to hide their power, to look helpless. And now they're bringing it up.

One thing I want to say to the brothers, I say, 'Don't be scared. Don't be threatened by the power that we're bringing out, because it's like we were icebergs. And that hidden power, when it's offered to society is going to be a great force for society to use'.

**John**: My involvement in Feminism started when I met Yoko, although at that time there was no word for it. We were two artists living together and she happened to be female and she wanted equal time and equal space. And that's the sort of dialogue between us which went on and on. The Women's Movement came out about a year or two after we'd met. And it was naturally related to it.

This is the First International Feminist Conference. It's historic and important. They're all trying and dialoguing. The radicals are saying, 'Well, what about this?' and the others are saying, 'Well in our country we have to do this'. The people here are from America, India, Norway, New Zealand, everywhere, and the difference in, say, a radical New Zealander and a radical American is immense, whether a female or male. Just the country differences are enough. You can't even pin the word radical or liberal or conservative on any of them.

**Yoko**: All women's organizations by nature are radical. Men in this society are also victims of the male society, so they're going through a fantastic change and it is a painful thing for them, too. Because of the social setup and convention, they were deprived from the pleasure of learning how to cook and now he's starting to open up that side, which is beautiful.

**John**: A man's work is never done, my dear! No, I just wanted to do it. All the females are brought up not knowing how to work tape recorders or fix their bike or whatever it is. And men are brought up not knowing how to cook or look after themselves. If you ever leave home, it's like only knowing half of what's going on. If nobody was around, I'd probably starve to death!

It's completely changed. It's been a process of four or five years. It was like having on eye shut. Once you start acknowledging that, yes, women are oppressed slaves, then you start seeing it in those terms. It's just an eye opener and you can never go back. We're not a completely liberated couple and we still go through a lot of struggle and it's usually for space.

I don't work on musical projects now. Either I write songs or don't, and then I go and record them. But it's almost like it's getting to be work. It's ruining the music. So I just do it when I feel like it and I get more interested in other things, because it's like after you leave school and you don't want to read a book. I'm almost like that about it, although I still dig it. Every time I've strapped the guitar on, It's (imitates choking) the same old jazz, so I just feel like breathing for a bit.

**John**: The first album I put out on my own had no title: *John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band*. Ringo was on that and then George was on *Imagine*.  Whoever was around was 'on'. When the Beatles 'split', it didn't mean to say that we'd never play on each other's sessions or anything. Had we all still been living in London, we probably would have been on each other's sessions. But then I moved here \[to New York\], so there was less of that. There is a lot going on between George and Ringo and Klaus and Nilsson and everybody's goofing off in London and L.A. and Jamaica. They're always on each other's sessions.

Just imagine The Beatles getting together again. Whatever they did would not be good enough because everybody has this incredible dream about how it was in the 60s and by the time it gets to the 80s, it'll be even bigger. But it would never be the same. Whatever we did would never be good enough. It could never be the same.

You know, it's just a dream. It's a real dream. I added an amendment to 'the dream is over', but we haven't woken up yet. So that's how we live.

But when it gets into a magazine or on the radio, people say, 'Oh, that's what you're doing, please keep doing that forever, so as we can get it adjusted in our heads as to what you are doing'.",0,1621742962

TheBeatles,nhucki,themaestroonline1,1,Simon Cowell Versus The Beatles,"**Defending the Undefendable, not breaking Cowell’s back**

Simon Cowell is an easy target for many and why not?  Is he not the man that makes money out of everybody else’s talent?  Is he not perceived as rude, abrupt and abrasive when addressing the qualities of others?  Is this a deliberate TV act?  Let’s hang on for one moment and look from the other side.  It’s interesting to reflect as it is now 20 years since the first Pop Idol which aired in 2001 

The Cowell industry has brought many big singing names to our households.  This goes without saying.  However, does he deserve credit for more than this?  Leona Lewis was voted London’s most influential woman in 100 years by Metro readers for International Womens’ Day 2011 and represented the UK vocally at the Olympics 2008.  She also turned down a huge figure from Harrod’s due to her animal rights beliefs because they still sell things made of fur.  She is a great example as a singer and person to young girls as they aspire to be significant adults.  Will Young, who won that very 2001 Pop Idol singing series, has done much for the LGBT movement, being proudly and openly exactly who he is, celebrating his identity.  Chris Moyles was pulled up by Ofcom for his homophobic remarks with regards to Will and Will has spoken out about his feelings of homophobia, both subliminal and intentional towards him, in a Newsnight episode September 2020.

[Beatles V Cowell Piano Demonstration](https://youtu.be/ZSoDBuz6T94)

## Pop Vocalists

Simon Cowell’s enterprises have discovered a huge range of talented pop vocal singers, but they have never fostered evolution, development, imagination or helped create musical genius.  They don’t set out to further develop the writing or creative side of music and they tend to lean towards particular types of vocal training.

## Musicianship

Three words from one song alone, *All You Need is Love* by the Beatles contain more musicianship than Simon Cowell has ever developed in others.

## Beats per Bar

EXPERIMENTAL METRE (BEATS PER BAR): Have you ever listened to the words “Love, love, love” and counted the beats?  Try it - it’s incredible.  As you count, you realise that there are a possible 7 beats per bar in this piece: 2+2+3.  Is this an influence from Indian Classical music thanks to Ravi Shankar KBE who they met a year before?  Very probably.  How many pop songs use 7/4 (or 4/4 alternating with 3/4).  Do the Beatles maintain 7/4?  Well, they almost do yes, they certainly continue alternating 4/4 with 3/4 metre although not with a consistent pattern (a sign of real genius).

## Vocals

Then the vocals commence for the first verse in two part harmony, the “Love, love, love” continuing over semiquaver (16th notes) and quaver (8th notes) rapid lyrics, “There’s nothing you can do that can’t be done”.

 

## Counterpoint and Melodies

As for the background, it was commissioned for the first ever live global television link, a satellite broadcast for TV called, “Our World”.  The aim was to create something that could readily be latched onto by listeners who didn’t have English as their first language.  “Love, love, love” seems to master this.  Is this why George Martin suggested using the French national anthem, the Marseillaise, at the beginning, to make it more international?  Do the Beatles stop there?  Put simply, no, they feature other works such as *In the Mood* (jazz sax near the end - perhaps a world link to the USA?).  In wouldn’t be out of character to suggest that the “love” message was Lennon counteracting the negativity that people in the USA may have been feeling towards the ruthless Vietnam war.  *Greensleeves* at half-tempo may well be a song comment on the Beatles English heritage.  There’s much more ‘overlapped’ material at the end and even the keys don’t match, creating a tonal-soup!  Tonality and genius fused.

## Instruments

As for instruments, McCartney on double bass, the use of a harpsichord (an instrument from the Baroque c. 1600-1750), the use of a backing track that a full orchestra was playing over the top of almost as a ‘click track’.... Genius!

## Musical Legacy

The extra-musical legacy?  Perhaps Bob Geldof could answer that.  He has been quoted as saying that he wanted the 1984 Band Aid Single, *Do They Know It’s Christmas* to be sung all over the world as *All You Need is Love* was.

So Simon Cowell, which is better: promoting a singer/vocalist, or promoting a legacy of musical evolution, growth and development?

A: I feel quite happy about the album. ""Walls And Bridges"" out now, the tittle of which, was sent from above in the guise of a public service announcement.

Q: How Wow! I was meaning to ask you, John, what you thought of the Beatlefest, and why you didn't go, and are you getting back together again, how's your immigration, and is it true about you and.......

A: Great. Nervous. You never know. Very appealing. If you want to help, write your congressperson, or some such similar.....

Q: About those dreadful stories that came out of L.A. with you and Harry, etc.....

A: Mostly fiction, with a grain of alcohol...

Q: I mean you don't have to answer, but did you rape a waitress in the Rainbow.....?

A: I never actually laid a hand on anyone, in fact, it was impossible, I was carried out.......

Q: But.... But.... Todd Rudgren said that you.......

A: That's what you get for reading fanzines.

Q: Do you like glitter?

A: Yes.

Q: Talking of the Beatlefest, didn't you find it strange that David Peel and Alex Beeinhisbennet were both there playing 5th Beatle?

A: Yes! Considering that the day before I'd seen Peel on cable TV screaming about The Beatles ripping people off etc. etc... Alex? Well, he's sooo controversial! He's just getting into Andy Warhol you know, he's very deep.

Q: Didn't you produce an album of Peel's for Apple?

A: Yes, one of the highlights of my career!

Q: Who else have you produced records for in your astonishing but sometimes perfectly ordinary life?

A: Elephant's Memory, Yoko, Harry... myself.

Q: Now that you've been on N.Y. 3 years, do you still....

A: If you look closely at the wonderful ""Walls And Bridges"", out now, album package, you will notice a little notice saying, ""I saw a U.F.O... "" why don't you ask me about that?

I understand that the Liverpool Institute was a grammar school and I was always under the impression that ‘Quarry Bank school’ was, in turn, also a grammar school. A quick Google search however reveals inconclusive results. 

Quarry Bank is now Calderstones which is a comprehensive - but this appears to have been only from 1967, when it merged with another girls’ grammar school.

Some people are pretty adamant that Quarry Bank has always been a comprehensive and that only 2/4 of the Beatles were Grammar School boys.

TheBeatles,ng4bhe,themaestroonline1,1,Did Simon Cowell just discover talent and destroy the development of Musicianship that the Beatles established as a UK heritage?," 

# Did Simon Cowell end the Pop Musician’s Musicianship?

### Popular Rock Pop Songs that have stood the test of time

How many bands have survived the test of time and are still household names with the young children of today’s generation?  Did you know that the Monkees *I’m a Believer* from 1967 was nominated for a Kid’s Choice Award?  The Rolling Stones 1965 *I Can’t Get no Satisfaction* is at No. 2 and Aretha Franklin is at No. 5 with *RESPECT* in the *Rolling Stones Magazine* “500 Greatest Songs of All Time”.  How is it that songs that are seemingly so ‘old’ are not knocked off the top of the list by modern sensations?

### Quick Pop Hit Wonders

The answer is simply that we live in a ‘microwave world’ and who is more responsible for this musically than Simon Cowell? Simon established the hit sensation TV shows such as *Pop Idol* and *X Factor* monopoly with the possibility of securing record deals for the winners. Do the children of today know who Will Young, the Pop Idol 2002 winner, is?

### The Beatles and Forming a World Class Band

*Time* Magazine may well have named him one of the 100 Most Influential People in the world, but is that truly a balanced opinion given that he has single-handedly hampered the development of musicians into long-term, fully-formed genii?  Let’s think for one moment how bands such as The Beatles evolved:  At 16 John Lennon forms a band, The Quarrymen, with some friends from school (1956) and a year later, they perform in a local church (St Peter’s Woolton) as well as a local jazz club (The Cavern). They played on the back of a float in part of a Rose Queen ceremony. These were local boys, honing their craft wherever they could find opportunities within their local community.  They gained a local residency and eventually a trip to Hamburg. These boys had a large local following and many pitfalls.  They worked through these over years, they fought to establish a reliable team, they refined their band name, they worked with live audiences and discovered what ‘worked’ and what didn’t. They tried different repertoire, both covers and their own songs. They experimented with amplification and mics, they later evolved in terms of studio techniques. They continually developed and inevitably progressed to become national and international names.

 

### Musicianship and developing the Holistic Musician

So, Simon Cowell, whilst you have undoubtedly created opportunities, where is the development of the artist? Where is the honing of the craft? Where is the commitment to the individual person and the long term? How do singers now evolve and respond to the environment around them? Why do we dismiss one name to make a new one the following year? Turnover, that’s what it’s about, turnover.  Making money, a new sensation sparks new interest. The ‘making money’ aspect has also been criticised by *The Daily Telegraph* who in an article dated 9th October 2011 revealed that the advance for the first album had been reduced from £1m to £150,000.

### What does a real Vocal Coach do?

A real vocal coach does not just teach singing, they help the artist evolve.  George Martin was the band equivalent.  The aim is to help musicians find their own style, an individual flavour that is different to those around them, essentially, their Unique Selling Point.  Part of seeking this individuality, helping the individual to blossom for who they really are, is also helping them evolve, develop, change and mature.  It is a journey that takes time and craft.

### Continually Growing to become a Better Musician

Where is the evolution of music and long term sincere quality and integrity?  Well, these go by the wayside. I personally challenge those in the current music industry to ensure that the next generation become well-trained, highly accomplished, continually evolving human beings who never fail to ensure that the arts become something long-lasting with a sense of permanence, integrity, flair and establishment.

*Robin Harrison is known via his vocal coach and pop and classical piano, as well as organ online academy,* [*www.the-maestro-online.com*](http://www.the-maestro-online.com/) *and has coached many successful professional musicians throughout his career, including singers who have released singles this year, 2021.*",0,1621426894

TheBeatles,nfu42w,Out_In_The_Tiles,1,Clearing out misconceptions about The Beatles - Part 1,"Hi everyone, I will be doing little blogs clearing out a misconception concerning The Beatles each time. Keep in mind that all information that will be presented on these blogs is written down by Kevin Howlett (Beatles' Historian). On this blog, we will be covering the next topic: The Beatles never recorded under acid.

L.S.D. indeed was a remarkably important part of their career they never recorded under its control. After all, they needed to have a certain attitude towards E.M.I. as it was a workplace. John stated: 'We couldn't work on pot. We never recorded under acid.' Ringo also talked about it: 'When we did take too many substances, the music was absolute shit.' While they did take marijuana during the *Help!* Recording Sessions, the last time they would record under a substance was going to be during the *Rubber Soul* Recording Sessions as it was considered not productive to take drugs while recording songs. In spite of all this, Ringo acknowledged that the existing experimentation present on *Rubber Soul* was because of the grass taken during its creation.

George also acknowledged in the 1990s that 'reefers are hard to avoid in The Beatles' story.' Nevertheless, Derek Taylor clearly states that although drugs indeed affected in a positive way to the writers, they are not encouraging anyone deliberately to take drugs.

TheBeatles,n7iv6b,pinkiepie5681,1,"""SGT pepper's lonely hearts club band"" movie. Review","So a couple of hours ago I said I was going to see the Sgt pepper movie, I just finished it, and I'm going to tell you how I felt about it. Okay, the covers were really boring that I didn't know what was going on at the time.  I mean, the covers weren't bad. They were just boring. And the story was quite random, and I mean having a sword fight with a weird doctor that liked to make people young? Just saying. Also, Strawberry fields is a dumb name, the same thing with ""Future villain band,"" and I'll talk about it right now.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The two names (Strawberry fields forever and future villain band)**

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, Strawberry is a good first name, but her last name is unusual. I know they were trying to name her after the song and that stuff, but fields are just a weird last name. They should have just called her Strawberry Anderson or something. Okay, but the ""future villain band"" sounds silly and out of a little kids movie. Like they also should call the band the blue meanie band or something I don't know?. But they should have thought about the names a little bit more.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The songs and dialogue.**

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so remember the first sentence when I said that the music was boring and I didn't know at the time? Well yeah, that was the whole movie, basically.  The covers were alright except the cover of "" ""because"" god, the way he sang that was bizarre, and I couldn't stop laughing at it because it was so bad it was funny. But they never talked to each other during the whole movie. The only person that talked in that movie was that mayor guy. And he didn't really have anything to do with the story except he was the mayor. I mean, it would be more important that Strawberry told Billy shears the magical instruments were stolen or when Mr. Mustard kidnapped Strawberry, and you would have heard her screaming. If they talked, it would make me more interested in the story, Like in ""Across the universe.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The end**

&amp;#x200B;

It was quite stupid that Strawberry died just to be brought back by Sgt pepper. Seeing Billy shears Greif of Strawberry. The funeral when he sang golden slumbers. It's just kind of, you know.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**In conclusion**

This movie should have done better. The music should have a little more spice into it.  I'm rather disappointed in this. If you haven't seen this movie go watch ""Across the universe"" instead if you already haven't.  I'll give it a 4.5/10",4,1620454418

I’m in a band called Laurel Canyon and we just put out our first single “Two Times Emptiness.” It’s very inspired by the Beatles from the 12-string, harmony, 60’s girl group inspiration and the fact that we wrote it line for line, eye for eye in completely co-written songwriting session. But we especially were inspired by Astrid Kirchherr and Robert Freeman’s photographs of The Beatles and their use of half-shadow.

Today I chose ""Yellow Submarine"", my least favorite album by the group but still amazing! Well, I will only rank the first side, and will not consider the songs on side 2. Don't get me wrong, side 2 sounds great to me, I just think it isn't really The Beatles. Without further ado, let's go!

===

6 - Only A Northern Song (An interesting concept for a song, for sure. I like it, it's just that it's not as strong as the others)

5 - All Together Now (A fun little tune by Paul McCartney. I find it to be very catchy!)

4 - It's All Too Much (Here is a great song! I love that organ riff, and the feedback in the beggining, and all the little details. Altough I think the song would be stronger if not as long as it is now and maybe in a more focused style, less ""jam-y"". Still, I love this song very much, and it's stuck in my head!)

3 - Yellow Submarine (A classic song from ""Revolver"". I thought about leaving this one and ""All You Need Is Love"" out from the ranking, since they are songs we've already seen before in The Beatles catalogue, but ultimately decided to have them here. Back to ""Yellow Submarine"", it's a very catchy song indeed; I love the backing vocals on the chorus and that last part on the verse, where I suppose the captain starts shouting between each line. The band playing is also nice and I love Ringo's vocals!)

2 - All You Need Is Love (Here is a song which I love! I find the lyrics to be very beautiful. So beautiful, in fact, that it made me cry. There was a day that I finished the song in tears. The instrumentation, for example the orchestra and the violin, I think they all work very well. The guitar solo is beautiful and the backing vocals on the chorus serve really well. The ending is also great, with all the orchestras doing many bits of what I think are different songs and also the ""Yesterday"" and ""She Loves You"" references always make me smile)

1 - Hey Bulldog (A winner in my book! The blues riff is absolutely addicting. The verse part where the song changes to B major also features astonishing bass playing by Paul McCartney; it pretty much makes that part. But my favorite part of the song is the ""you can talk to me"" part. First of all, listen to the bass; it's doing very interesting rhythms. Secondly, the chords, with all the what I will call ""upward line cliches"" (with chords staying the same except one note drifting away upwards) work really well for the song and give this a very catchy vibe. The guitar solo is also very well played and works really well in the progression. Also I will point out the outro, with the riff being played and complemented with another similar one in another chord. Also Paul and John having fun talking and laughing and screaming is priceless. 

And there is also the lyrics; altough I'm not sure if they are supposed to have any meaning, I take it as a letter to someone who is really arrogant and thinks they are better than everyone, which would be the bulldog. The narrator even asks ""what makes you think you're something special when you smile?"", and also questions the certainty the bulldog has, ""you think you've got it but you haven't got a clue"". Then the narrator proceeds to tell the bulldog that if he's lonely he can talk to him. I'm not sure if I'm going too far out but that's what I understand. What a great song!)

TheBeatles,n1b78r,DaviAlfredo,1,Ranking Ringo (self-titled album) songs,"Hello everyone! So now I decided to rank songs from the album ""Ringo"", by Ringo Starr. This is not The Beatles, but I didn't know where I would post this, so I will post this here. If this the wrong place, first of all sorry about it and please let me know and I will post it in the right place. Also, one more thing, I'm not going to include the extra songs added in later prints, so there will be no ""Down and Out"", ""It Don't Come Easy"", nor ""Early 1970"". Well, without further ado, let's go!

===

10 - Devil Woman (A fun rock and roll tune, I like it! It's just that all the other tracks are better, but still, great vocals, awesome bass, and I specially love the piano and horns part. Also the distorted guitars are awesome! And by the way, I like the ""Sexy Sadie"" reference)

9 - Oh My My (This one being here might shock some people. Don't get me wrong, I love this song! But I just think everything else is better! I kinda think the songs goes for too long, and also think it should have had an extra part, but still, this is still great. Also the bass really sticks out. This song being in here only goes to show how great this album is!)

8 - Have You Seen My Baby (Hey, what a catchy tune! It kinda goes for too long, but still it's great. The drumming really sticks out, the piano is awesome, and my favorite part is the ""hold on"" part, with all the horns and everything. Great song!)

7 - Sunshine Life For Me (Sail Away Raymond) (I love the vibe of this song. Seems to have a pretty strong country vibe, love it! I love the way the melodies go on top of each other, seems really good! The melody seems to be based on the major pentatonic, which I always love! Love how the song gets more complex as it goes on. Great tune!)

6 - I'm The Greatest (An awesome Lennon tune. Love the piano and organ. The bass also really serves the song as well. The drumming is on point. Also the backing vocals in the chorus are great and the references to Sgt. Pepper's with Billy Shears and the crowd and everything, so good! Also I love the outro)

5 - You And Me (Babe) (Hey! What a catchy, catchy tune by George and Mal! Love the horn work, and the drumming really serves the song. Also love the bridge (""now I wanna tell you the pleasure really was mine"") with the piano and horns. Also those secondary dominants and augmented chord, so good! Also the strings are very good. This is one of those songs thay make me want to dance! Speaking of wanting to dance...)

4 - Step Lightly (Oh my! This may be my favorite song Ringo wrote alone. Just wow. Well there's a lot to talk about here. First, the electric piano sets the mood for this jazzy song. The I bIII IV I progression is also very beautiful. And the counter melodies by all the winds, guitars and vocals work really, really well. If it wasn't enough, there's an instrumental solo at the middle, with tap dancing, a great part by the winds and those ""sha-la-las"" are amazing. The drumming and bass are on point too! Just wow)

3 - Six O'Clock (What a beautiful tune. The piano is amazing, and that moog-like solo and the backing vocals by Paul and Linda McCartney are superb. A great Paul's song. And the lyrics are beautiful. The drumming is on point and the bass as well)

2 - You're Sixteen (You're Beautiful And You're Mine) (Oh my my, what a cover! The piano is amazing, the backing vocals are beautiful, and the drumming and bass are on point, as always. I specially love the bass on the bridge, where it goes up and down minor seven chords. Love it! The best part of the song is the kazoo-like solo. What an addicting and catchy melody! And that goes for the whole song, so good! The original had it's charm, but this cover took that and made something fairly different, and incredibly wonderful! Truly one of the highlights of the album)

1 - Photograph (What can I say? The melody is happy, but the lyrics are sad, which makes this song a bittersweet song. The strings compliment very well the song, and the bass is absolutely fantastic. The bridge has a very beautiful chord progression too. The best part of the song, in my opinion, is the saxophone solo. Just wow, what an amazing song!)

===

And this concludes the ranking of the album! This one was specially hard to make; it's truly difficult to rank an album full of awesome songs. And so, what do you think? Do you agree? Do you disagree?",0,1619722027
TheBeatles,n1aclw,DaviAlfredo,2,Ranking Let It Be songs,"Hey everyone! So today I'm going to rank yet again another Beatles album. My plan is to eventually have all of them ranked; still, today I'll focus on ""Let It Be"". It's a solid album, altough one of the weakest between The Beatles albuns, in my opinion. Well, anyways, let's get ranking!


12 - Dig It (Sounds like a fun little jam. I like it, altough it's not very strong)

11 - Maggie Mae (Similarly to ""Dig It"", sounds like a fun little tune. It's just that it's short and not nearly as good as everything else on the album)

10 - For You Blue (A great blues number; I love the melody. I just miss the acoustic guitar, which makes me prefer the ""naked""version. Still it's a great tune!)

9 - One After 909 (Sounds like rock and roll fun for me! Great electric piano, fun bass and nice fills by Ringo!)

8 - Across The Universe (Sounds like a very beautiful tune. The ""over-the-top"" orchestration doesn't bother me that much; actually, it has a certain charm to it. Still, I also love the acoustic version, and I'm not sure if I'm a fan of the effect on Lennon's voice)

7 - The Long And Winding Road (Another beautiful tune. This one seems to be driven by the piano. I love the orchestration, and would go as far as to say that I prefer this than the ""naked"" version. Still, the ""naked"" version is beautiful in it's own way too. The lyrics stand out to me here as well)

6 - Two Of Us (This song gives me a warm friendship vibe. Seems like a song dedicated to a beautiful friendship, like a friend that makes your heart warm and makes you smile. I really love this song. Also those guitar interludes after the bridge (after the ""that stretches out ahead"" part) are really fun. I also like the outro)

5 - Dig A Pony (Here is a great tune! First of all, the guitar lick in the introduction is really interesting, I think. Great drumming, great vocals; love the harmonies on the chorus, and the best part of all is the guitar solo. It's incredibly good)

4 - I've Got A Feeling (I love the riff. The melody also seems great, and I love the bridge (""everybody had a hard year"" part). Also those bits that seem to go up and down, like at the end of the song, so good!)

3 - I Me Mine (Oh my, what an addicting track! The instrumentation is amazing and the chord progression really stands out in the bridge. If it wasn't enough, the song still goes to a rocking part, with great drumming, great guitar parts and an awesome bass. What an incredible tune!)

2 - Let It Be (The lyrics here are absolutely beautiful. The melody, which sticks to the pentatonic majorly, is also amazing. It actually reminds me a bit of the ""Rocky Raccoon"" melody; the two songs are in C and use the major pentatonic. The guitar solo also uses the pentatonic and is amazing. The solo from the single version is also amazing, but the solo of the ""naked"" version seems just ok. I don't mind the orchestration that much, the drumming is awesome and the harmonies are amazing. Also the organ really stands out. This all makes for one of the best Beatles songs)

1 - Get Back (What to say? This one was one of my favorites since I was a kid! First of all, Ringo is doing a ""gallop"" rhythm which really sticks out. The guitar is amazing, and so are Billy Preston's electric piano parts. I miss the false ending from the single version. Still, awesome song and a great way to finish the album, I think).

TheBeatles,n0makj,DaviAlfredo,1,Ranking Help! songs,"And hello everyone! Today I'm going to rank the songs of yet another Beatles album; this time, ""Help!"". I love this album and think it's very iconic in many places. Overall a great album, and honest maybe even a bit underrated. Without further ado, here comes my ranking:

14 - Dizzy Miss Lizzy (It's an ok rock and roll song. I like it, but I think the riff gets very repetitive and kinda boring. Great drumming by Ringo)

13 - Act Naturally (Overall a nice little cover. I like Ringo's vocals, and specially like the chorus and last verse with their harmonies)

12 - You Like Me Too Much (Interesting piano riff at the beggining. I like the melody, and specially the parts where there are harmonies. That ""if you leave me"" part always sticks out to me. But by far the best part of the song for me is the call and response part of the electric piano and guitar. One of the best moments of the whole album, I would dare say)

11 - Another Girl (A fun song. I like the melody and harmonies. The guitar in the background is also amazing, doing all these different melodies. And that bridge that changes the key is also great, featuring beautiful harmonies and an awesome chord progression going back to the original key. Good one!)

10 - It's Only Love (Overall a beautiful tune. I like the verse melody; it puts me on a good mood. The chorus also has a great melody. I like the instrumentation as well. Overall an awesome tune, it's just that the next songs are better)

9 - I Need You (A beautiful Harrison tune. Love it very much. It has this passionate vibe, I think, really makes me emotional. I love the harmonies and actually quite like the pedal guitar thing. A beautiful tune, indeed!)

8 - Tell Me What You See (Here's another one that I feel emotional. Such a beautiful song! I also think it's very catchy. The lyrics are definitely a highlight: ""big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away; if you put your trust in me, I'll make bright your day"", just beautiful. And the chorus is amazing, with that little electric piano line that's very well played. What an amazing song!)

7 - You've Got To Hide Your Love Away (The instrumentation is good. I like the flute-like part late in the song, and of course the catchy chorus; the lyrics are also very interesting!)

6 -The Night Before (Pure rock and roll fun! Love those harmonies in the ""now today I find you have changed your mind"". The bridge is also amazing, and that guitar solo, so good!)

5 - You're Going To Lose That Girl (Very interesting instrumentation, I think! Ringo is rocking those bongos in the background! Love the melody and the call and response thing. The bridge changing keys is amazing, and the guitar solo is fantastic. What can I say? Amazing song!)

4 - Ticket To Ride (Ringo's drumming is so iconic! The guitar riff is amazing and the harmonies are great. Speaking of harmonies, those in the bridge are amazing! Also the ending is pure fun)

3 - I've Just Seen A Face (This one is a song that I know for quite sometime. It's a very fun and fast song. And the melody is killer; and the chorus, so beautiful. This song also puts me in a good mood! I always feel like dancing when listening to this. The acoustic solo is also great!)

2 - Help! (What a great intro; those ""Helps!"" in the background are so, so, so good! And it doesn't go downhill from there; the background vocals are amazing, with all those ""now... these days are gone... and now I find..."", so good! The buildup is amazing, and that ending, with that A6 chord, beautiful!)

1 - Yesterday (I think many people were expecting this at first place, but what can I say? It's an amazing song! Great vocals, great lyrics, great guitar, beautiful string score, thank you Sir George Martin!)

So far ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" has became of the most memorable moments of the 60's music, really enjoyed the last minutes vibe, with Starr (idk if it was him on the drums in that particular track) giving an amazing perfomance into the background while the boys lead us into a mesmerizing chord.

I'm wondering if there's any similar stuff from their works? Thanks y'all!

Mostly it just comes down to him having a crappy attitude and his songs and voice not being as good.. A lot of his Beatles songs are him complaining. And it really pissed him off that he wasn’t as acclaimed as John and Paul, but no one was as talented as them. He just seemed to be perpetually dour and resentful, despite his proclaimed spirituality.  However, while my guitar gently weeps some thing and here comes the sun are definitely top 20 Beatles songs, and all things must Pass is my second favorite Beatles solo album.

TheBeatles,mwxiq1,SynthFrenetic,1,Across the Universe (song) appreciation post,"I've been with this opinion for a while, so decided to bring it up. Is it me, or Across the Universe is criminally underrated? I mean, it's kinda a recognizable song from their late era, but it's never seen up there with songs like Here Comes the Sun, Let it Be, Something or Come Together.

Especially taking the WWF version, which I'd say it's on my top 5 (Currently A Day in the Life is my top spot).

Speaking of the WWF version, I think it really shows the difference George Martin initially had with the original song comparing with the narrowed down Phil Spector version. If Martin was going to make each Let it Be/Get Back song like that, ooh that could be my favorite album or at least top 3 for sure, despite I don't feel it has the retro Get Back Project feeling they were looking for.

I also checked the Naked version, but still felt very similar to the original LIB, and definitely not better than the WWF version.

So, is it just me, or anyone else has a little love spot for Across the Universe? I love that it has a feeling of ""Everything will come to an end, but it will be ok"". Should I check some of Lennon's solo stuff for similar songs?",0,1619190896

TheBeatles,mt2i55,SynthFrenetic,1,Your Beatles album rank/tier list AND WHY.,"I see lots of people posting their Tier List or simply trying to rank Beatles albums but rarely mentioning their reasons until someone asks. So, in order to bring some more depth discussions, which is your Beatles album rank and why?

13. Yellow Submarine

I don't think this needs much description. 13 tracks, 7 of them are George Martin's compositions, 2 are oldies from other albums, and the other 4 are either left-overs and barely remarkable tracks. I don't think Martin solo work here is *that* bad, but surely feel a little out here.

Favorite Song: It's All Too Much

12. Beatles for Sale

Another very popular opinion. The title describes it all as well ""Eight Days a Week"". The Beatles working 24/8 and almost selling out just to deliver new works, after recording a movie, an album, Long Tall Sally EP and shows and BFS being the result of all this, 1964 just seemed a year to have no end. Most songs aren't catch and easily forgettable. While pretty similar to the original, Rock and Roll music is a pretty interesting cover and Every Little Thing is the only song I actually stick with.

Favorite Song: Every Little Thing

11. Let it Be

Still, little to no surprise here. A failed execution of a great project sums this album very well. I still haven't the opportunity to listen to Naked, but similarly to BFS, not many catch songs and IMO, Across the Universe, Get Back and Let it Be can all be found in a better version on their non-album counterparts.

Favorite Song: For Your Blue

10. A Hard Day's Night

Now things get more interesting. Nonetheless, a great album and most positions now will all be defined by decimal of points. AHDN certainly was a huge step for the band, not just because of the movie, but for also being their first album with original compositions (Something which would just be achieved again from RS and beyond). BUT, that also might be the biggest album cons for me. It just feels more and more of the same. Some mature compositions such as And I Love Her and If I Fell, but that's it. At least, unlike BFS, these songs are quite catch, or at least the song melody comes in your head as soon as you read their title.

Favorite Song: A Hard Day's Night

9. With the Beatles

This definitely makes me look like I don't like the early Beatles, but I do, I promise. WTB was basically a  Please Please Me: Part 2, but with some awesome tracks. George Harrison first composition and covers hand selected by them, giving both the Beatles songs originality and the diversity from their covers (One of the main cons of AHDN as I mentioned earlier).

Favorite Song: All My Loving

8. Magical Mystery Tour

The last album to finish my collection and also closing of the psychedelic era. The album probably has some of their best tracks such Strawberry Fields Forever, Penny Lane, I am the Walrus and All You Need is Love, but these are perfectly balanced with songs you barely hear anywhere other than an album run. Blue Jay Way is very catch too, this alone was worth buying the album as I had other 6 tracks from the album on compilations.

Favorite Song: Strawberry Fields Forever

7. Please Please Me

Almost everything I said on With the Beatles applies here. Great compositions with a slice of covers which bring some diversity to the album. For me, it also has some dated sound which is even nostalgic. Also, the album which started it all. It's also a so easy and joyful listen is probably the album I listened more without even being my favorite.

Favorite Song: Please Please Me

6. Help!

Some say the last of the Early album, others say the first of the psychedelic/mature album. If you notice, this is, chronologically, the highest album on the list since Please Please Me, so the first one to surpass their debut for me. When things really start getting interesting, it's hard to mention a bad song on it. Well, I personally, can't.

Favorite Song: Ticket to Ride

5. The Beatles (White Album)

Perhaps their most popular album of these days, I also believe the one with the most divided opinion. At first, I really hated it, and even said I would just take about 3 tracks out of 30. After the second listen, the other ones started growing on me and the album just kept getting higher on the list. Definitely their most varied work.

Favorite Song: Back in the  U.S.S.R.

4. Revolver

Along White Album, this is another album I see it has a lot of popularity here on Reddit. Despite never taking drugs, this album as a whole and especially ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" definitely take me to another state of mind. Also, a very experimental album, which isn't some of my favorite stuff, however I feel it has some hidden gems which are just being dug and enjoyed over 50 years since its initial release.

Favorite Song: Yellow Submarine

3. Rubber Soul

I remember when I was just getting used to Beatles I, of course, went to see their discography and their tracks, and RS definitely looked nothing interesting for me, and I didn't get why so many people seemed to love it. Oh god, how wrong I was... This was the first Beatles album to really blow my mind, I could even say Revolver is better than this one but too much psychedelia made me prefer RS with time as it seems more an ""organized album"".

Favorite Song: Norwegian Wood (This Bird has Flown)

2. Abbey Road

Revealing the number 2, the number 1 is indirectly revealed. One of the things I love in life is when you are definitely hyped for something, and it yet surprises you and I can definitely say I felt this for Abbey Road and Sgt. Pepper's. While technically their last album, it's also Beatles at their peak in creativity: All 4 Beatles have equally good compositions, some of which still sound fresh to date. Definitely the main con point of the album is the amount of unfinished songs. I think everyone would love to see a final version of I Want You, and She's so Heavy as well every Medley song. However, it's simply majestic how unfinished songs can be classics when it comes to Beatles.

Favorite Song: Here Comes the Sun

1. Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

What to say about what I believe is the best album ever? I feel some people are more and more disagreeing with this, but for me, it's unbeatable. The kind of album I say if you change a centimeter, it won't be as good as it is. I remember when I was listening to their discography and reached Rubber Soul, I was like: ""Ok, this was pretty good"", then I went to Revolver ""Ok it can't get much better than this"" and when I finished Pepper ""It can get better than that"". I don't think I even have words  to express how much I love it.

Favorite Song: A Day in the Life

I think that's it. Sorry if a few albums seemed to have a vague critic, sometimes I just can't explain why I like certain things than others. I hope you can relate, and I'm curious on what you agree and disagree with me on your album opinions!

I also would like to dedicate this post to my father, who sadly passed away earlier this month due to COVID-19 complications. It was him who introduced me to the Beatles almost as young as I can remember. I remember listening to 1 on a few family meetings but especially on these last few months when he laid on bed while I worked on my PC, and we used to listen to the Beatles on the more varied medias, Vinyl, CD, compilations, etc.

TheBeatles,mqpkr0,Joe_George5437,1,"DISCUSSION: Should The Beatles have continued their career as a band into the 1970s? For the sake of this discussion, if their relations as a band were much better than they were in 1969 should The Beatles have continued to make music as The Beatles in the 70s?","To answer my question I think not. I believe that The Beatles reached the peak of their careers by the end of the 60s. It seemed by the end of 1969 that the end was already among them after releasing their final masterpiece *Abbey Road*. But if in some alternate or unexpected turn of events and the band did not disband in 1969 and continued their work as a band into the 1970s would have been something of interest. There is good and bad to them sticking around as a band longer than they did.

Good:

\- Would have allowed them to work with new and different styles/genres.

\- Usage of different instrumentations like the synthesizer in more depth than how they did on *Abbey* *Road* (You can decide if the usage of the synth would have been good or bad).

Bad:

\- If their relations weren't strained by 1969, then the 1970s would have done it to them. I see it as the longer they were together their relationship as a band and overall friendship was depleting.

\- ""All good things must come to an end"". This old saying would apply here very well in saying that although it would be good to have more of The Beatles in general who is to say that their music would still be chart-topping into the 70s? I'd rather have a short but successful and remembered legacy for the band instead of a long and drawn-out career of mediocre material.

\- Lastly, I think they should have had their solo careers instead of staying together. Yes, it would be good to have other's input on your music and to have a band to help you record but it would have been more of a burden for them. They could express themselves more freely and clearly rather than having others tell you no.",4,1618403526

But I've listened to all of their (Major) Albums all the way through. The reason I say major is because I know there are a few EPs and stuff they made before their larger albums, which I haven't listened to (yet).

[B]13. Yellow Submarine

Not gonna lie this album slightly sucked. The only song I enjoy on this album is the title track itself, Yellow Submarine. Besides that its really just not engaging nor pleasurable to listen to. If you like it thats fine but its not for me. 1/10

[B]12. Hard Days Night

Better than the last by far but still kinda meh for me. I like the title track, and a few others like And I love Her and I should Have Known Better, but overall didn't butter my muffin. 2.5/10

[B]11. With the Beatles

decent album but the only songs I really loved are Please Mr Postman and Roll Over Beethoven. The others songs aren't bad by any means, I can certainly enjoy them but I wouldn't regularly listen to them. 
3.5/10

[B]10. Help!

Help! is pretty good, I enjoy a fair few songs here, Help, The Night Before, I Need You, Dizzy Miss Lizzy and Yesterday. Overall good. But doesn't really stack up to what comes after. Points for Yesterday though. Good Song.
4.5/10

[B]9. Rubber Soul

I like Drive my Car, Norwegian Wood, Nowhere man, Im looking through you, Wait, And If I needed someone.
Good Album. I really enjoyed it. Different feel to some of their other ones but I really enjoyed it. solid 6/10

[B]8. Beatles for Sale

I've seen people say they don't like this album, for some reason. I liked it. No Reply, Babys In Black, Rock and Roll Music, 8 Days a week. These are my favourites but really I enjoy most songs here. 6/10

[B]7. Magical Mystery Tour

Not a brilliant album however, the songs Strawberry Fields Forever, Penny Lane, Your Mother Should Know make up for this. The other songs are average, but these...*chefs kiss*
7/10

[B]6. Please Please Me

really good album. I like Misery, Anna, Chains, Boys, Love Me Do, and Twist and Shout. I like the album. Might be controversial putting it above other albums but hey, my personal opinion. Super good album, also the first I listened to. 7.5/10

[B]5. Let it Be

Let it Be is a really nice album. the title track is really an amazing song. I like most of these songs a lot. Super nice album. 7.5/10

[B]4. White Album

fucking amazing. ObLaDee ObLaDa, Back in the USSR, rocky raccoon, Dear Prudence, I'm so tired, Blackbird, honestly I could go on. Many amazing songs. Very, Very good Album. 
8.5/10

[B]3. Revolver

Also amazing. Taxman, I'm only sleeping, And Your Bird can sing, also this is the album I first heard Eleanor Rigby. Easily one of my favourite songs ever. I think it was also on Yellow Submarine? Which is slightly ironic considering how lackluster that album is. 9/10

[B]2. Abbey Road

I like every song on Abbey Road. Come Together is my favourite, but all of them are downright brilliant. Truly an amazing album. I love this album.
9.9/10.

[B]1. Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

probably not a surprising choice. I love every single song besides Within you Without You. Every single song is truly amazing. With a Little Help from my Friends is my favourite, However the entire album is a masterpiece. 10/10.

also favourite Beatle is Paul, followed closely by Ringo. Ringo seems chill.",1,1617484629

I got those on CD later and now recently I’ve bought the whole thing on iTunes. The music is awesome when I play it through my stereo. But when I listen on headphones it’s really annoying because the stereo mixes are weird, so it will have like all the instruments in one ear and just the vocals in the other. Or instruments and vocals in the left and a guitar solo in the right. Or drums in one and all other instruments in the other with little to no blending. These are not exact descriptions of any particular songs, but in general it all seems to be mixed like that, in great contrast to the more modern music I listen to (80s metal, 90s pop, 2000s metal). What was happening in the 60s that people felt they had to mix like that?  Weren’t some of The Beatles’ recordings originally in mono?  What happened to that?

If anyone can explain this, that would be cool. I know a little bit about recording as I record and mix using a DAW but I’m pretty new to the whole 60s music thing and I don’t know how the whole recording-on-tape thing worked.

TheBeatles,m51yfo,mceleanor,1,I made an alternate version of Sgt Pepper by replacing each song with songs by other artists,"I mostly stuck to songs from the late 60s/early 70s. I decided not to include solo Beatles tracks, and I only included each artist once (except for Nick Drake, who replaces the intro and reprise with Hazey Jane I and II)

I'll list them below, with the original track - replacement track *artist name* (reason)

1. Sgt. Pepper's Intro - Hazey Jane I *Nick Drake* (I love Drake, and I love both of his Hazey Jane songs. The strings in this song mirror the strings at the beginning of Sgt Pepper. I thought about doing both ""Ram On""s from Paul's solo album, but I decided that using a solo Beatle's songs would be cheating.)

2. With A Little Help From My Friends - Somebody To Love *Queen* (Freddie and Ringo, trying to find somebody to love with their three harmonizing wingmen)

3. Lucy In The Sky with Diamonds - Rhiannon *Fleetwood Mac* (spacey songs about a mysterious girl)

4. Getting Better - For Once In My Life *Stevie Wonder* (both song's protagonists had a tough life, until they found love)

5. Fixing A Hole - The Only Living Boy In New York *Simon and Garfunkel* (both star a protagonist who is alone, and I think they have similar vibes. This is the first pairing I don't love. ""Have You Ever Seen The Rain"" by CCR, or another drug related song would have probably fit better, but I couldn't find any that ~sounded right. Plus I wanted to include a Paul Simon song. I'm open to suggestions on this.)

6. She's Leaving Home - Only The Good Die Young *Billy Joel* (these two songs are portraying the same story: SLH is the parent's POV; OTGDY is the POV of the man from the motor trade. I also don't love this pairing, maybe a Beach Boys song about running away would fit? I couldn't think of one. Maybe ""Cecelia"" by S&amp;G would have fit better? Anyway, I wanted a Billy Joel song on the list.)

7. Being for the Benefit of Mr Kite - Sympathy for the Devil *The Rolling Stones* (these songs have the same chaotic vibe and the protagonists both sound creepy (a carny and the Devil)

8. Within You Without You - The Rain Song *Led Zeppelin* (both are laid back and atmospheric. George Harrison actually inspired Page and Plant to write the song when he complained that Zep never wrote ballads)

9. When I'm Sixty-Four - Our House *Crosby Stills Nash and Young* (I live them both, but they're both a little cheesy. Two songs about a couple who loves each other.)

10. Lovely Rita - Sweet Jane *Velvet Underground* (Sane vibe. Two ""girl songs"" about a guy who falls for a working woman. Both are a little psychedelic, and have good breakdowns/fade outs at the end

11. Good Morning Good Morning - Mr Blue Sky *Electric Light Orchestra* (listening to these back to back, you could swear Jeff Lynne wrote it as a cover. Same kind of off-kilter melody, both are about ~rebirth, both are upbeat.)

12. Sgt Pepper's Reprise - Hazey Jane II *Nick Drake* (killer song, love Nick Drake, matches the first track.)

13. A Day In The Life - Surf's Up *The Beach Boys* (both are slightly lesser known tracks that non-fans doesn't know about. Both are one song split into sections. A Day In The Life ends the greatest album of all time, Surf's Up ends it's album, and was the last (and maybe best) song put out from the Smile Sessions until the 2000s.)

Here's the playlist! The album ends up being around 20 minutes longer, but I think it's a great listen! https://open.spotify.com/playlist/20HuJIKM506iJpEHvQ6Gfp?si=aLZ8VNLTSaWdS-Mb1yFtLg",0,1615749605

TheBeatles,m35v8o,Snoo13786,1,why the ebatl;es music stopped progressing n it sounds like they cared less in the music," the beatles stopped progressing n declined after 1966.  They got worse,   they stopped progressing n either tried too much, or didnt care at all.   george thought sgt peppers was going backwards n thats right.  gohn  didnt care at all that much anymore, gohn thought it got too old n  stale. paul tried too much, the band was declining n paul didnt see  that. he wanted to be the leader.  It probably started with the band  getting old, plus gohn n paul were working together for too much at that  point, n epstien died which made them drift aimlessly after 1966, more  noticeably with magical mystery tour, the film n the ep.  the music  wasnt as good either, it was good but it didnt really progress or  anything, or get any better.  let it be was good n different n seems  like its a progression, but its not progression.  anything after magical  mystery tour sounds like gohn getting bored in the music, paul trying  too much, ringo not caring necause hes ringo so things seemed good to  him like before, n harrison getting table scraps of his songs being on  track listing.  once the ideas that happened because of his supression  that released after the beatles were disbanded n a little before, n some  before 1967, his music kind of stopped being ideafilled , no new  ideas.Paul tried too much to progress n to keep alive a dying band.   Plus the music of all 3 went in different directions.  too much paul n  gohn songs made the 2 lasy n not caring as much. what happened to the  experimentation in resolser or rubber soul. what happened to the  colabboration with dylan n the birds, did it stop, i dont know. maybe  thats another reason. if the band cant do anything new or make it new n  becaomes lasy because of success or doing the same thing too much maybe  thats whats also happened to kill the band. maybe they thought they were  going forwrad after 2966, maybe only paul did, maybe ringo did.  maybe  not all of them. theres a good chance its not all of them.  paul doing  what he did n the others doing what they did to eacother n the band made  things worse too.  epstien dying n the troubles of finding new manager n  doing more adult things liek apple corp ortrying to be their own people  who ran the beatles maybe made less time for music n made it less  priority, in 1966 brian n george martin did all the work so that they  can have time for recording n making music, epsecially when rubber soul  wwas recorded n resolser",5,1615511492

Originally I wanted to write about how the Beatles influenced my country's musical/popular culture, but couldn't find really good resources for that, so I'm looking for something else instead. I was thinking of writing how Liverpool and its tourism changed and is revolving around Beatles, but I'm not a tourism major.
I was also thinking about writing about the 60s and the impact the band had on this era, but this is still too broad and need to narrow it down until tomorrow.

George means something like ""farmer""....yeah pretty random

Ringo means the strong/hard one. It's also in some way fitting.

And John means ""gracious god or birth gifted by god""

The one thing I’ve always managed to do, whether at home or on the road, is to write new songs. I know that some people, when they get to a certain age, like to go to a diary to recall day-to-day events from the past, but I have no such notebooks. What I do have are my songs, hundreds of them, which I’ve learned serve much the same purpose. And these songs span my entire life’*** Paul McCartney, The Lyrics

In this extraordinary book, with unparalleled candour, Paul McCartney recounts his life and art through the prism of 154 songs from all stages of his career – from his earliest boyhood compositions through the legendary decade of The Beatles, to Wings and his solo albums to the present. Arranged alphabetically to provide a kaleidoscopic rather than chronological account, it establishes definitive texts of the songs’ lyrics for the first time and describes the circumstances in which they were written, the people and places that inspired them, and what he thinks of them now. Presented with this is a treasure trove of material from McCartney’s personal archive – drafts, letters, photographs – never seen before, which make this also a unique visual record of one of the greatest songwriters of all time.

We learn intimately about the man, the creative process, the working out of melodies, the moments of inspiration. The voice and personality of Paul McCartney sings off every page. There has never been a book about a great musician like it.

***‘I hope that what I’ve written will show people something about my songs and my life which they haven’t seen before. I’ve tried to say something about how the music happens and what it means to me and I hope what it may mean to others too’*** Paul McCartney

In  November, a slipcase containing two books with the lyrics of  Paul  McCartney will be published, each is 480 pages long. Paul is also  going  to write about each song, under which circumstances it was  conceived,  and what he thinks of it in hindsight. He will also be  supplying  memorabilia to illustrate the book, including never before  seen  letters, papers and photos. The 154 songs are arranged  alphabetically  and span over his career – from 1956 to the  present.

*A work of unparalleled candor and splendorous beauty, The Lyrics celebrates the creative life and the musical genius of Paul McCartney through 154 of his most meaningful songs.* 

  
*From his early Liverpool days, through the historic decade of The Beatles, to Wings and his long solo career, The Lyrics pairs  the definitive texts of 154 Paul McCartney songs with first-person  commentaries on his life and music. Spanning two alphabetically arranged  volumes, these commentaries reveal how the songs came to be and the  people who inspired them: his devoted parents, Mary and Jim; his  songwriting partner, John Lennon; his “Golden Earth Girl,” Linda  Eastman; his wife, Nancy McCartney; and even Queen Elizabeth, among many  others. Here are the origins of “Let It Be,” “Lovely Rita,”  “Yesterday,” and “Mull of Kintyre,” as well as McCartney’s literary  influences, including Shakespeare, Lewis Carroll, and Alan Durband, his  high-school English teacher.*

*With images from McCartney’s personal archives—handwritten texts, paintings, and photographs, hundreds previously unseen—The Lyrics, spanning sixty-four years, becomes the definitive literary and visual record of one of the greatest songwriters of all time.*",0,1614167965

TheBeatles,lkk5pk,DaviAlfredo,1,Ranking Abbey Road songs,"Hey there! 

Now I will be ranking all songs from Abbey Road, probably my favorite Beatles album, from worst to best. All of the songs here are amazing, so this is more from least favorite to most favorite. Let's go?

===

17 - Sun King (Beautiful melody and harmony. Great chord progression)

16 - Golden Slumbers (I love the vocals and piano here, and the orchestra works great)

15 - Carry That Weight (Catchy song, with a cool throwback. Also Ringo's vocals really shine here)

14 - Her Majesty (A fun short tune, but there's actually a lot packed here: many different chords, all very interesting)

13 - The End (Great drumming, great guitar, great orchestras)

12 - Polythene Pam (Fun tune to sing along and play along. Very fast paced and a great guitar solo!)

11 - Because (Those harmonies. Oh my!)

10 - Mean Mr. Mustard (What a great bass! What a great progression! Love that waltz bit at the end)

9 - She Came In Through The Bathroom Window (An incredibly fun song from the medley! Great bass, great drumming, great progression! The lyrics are also very interesting. I love the key change from A to C and the many guitar licks all throughout)

8 - I Want You (She's So Heavy) (A Heavy song. Incredible bass, incredible organ, especially that part where it goes down after the first ""She's so"", incredible drumming! Those harmonies on that ""She' so heavy"" part, and that bluesy ""I want you"" part, so good!)

7 - Oh! Darling (Oh my! What a vocal performance! The piano and guitars work on it's favour, and the bass played by George Harrison is simply amazing and melodic. Also nice backing vocals)

6 - Octopus's Garden (The best Ringo song on The Beatles! Great vocals and chord progression. All the guitar licks and the guitar solo up the song by a TON! The backing vocals are beautiful, especially the ""lies beneath the ocean waves"". The lyrics are also very beautiful)

5 - You Never Give Me Your Money (The best song on the medley, also the one thay opens it. It's actually a medley by itself; the ""You never give me your money"" piano driven part flows well into the ""out of college"" part, which features a great piano playing and great chord progressions. The ""Oh that magic feeling"" part has beautiful harmonies, then comes the excellent guitar solo. ""One sweet dream"" is simply amazing and then there's that little coda fade out)

4 - Maxwell's Silver Hammer (An incredibly well made song! First of all, that bass. George Harrison knocks it out of the park! Especially that second chorus, with the descending triplet-like pattern. Great backing vocals, love the ""doo-doo-doo-doo-doo"", great piano playing, and that moog! Also the lyircs are very interesting)

3 - Come Together (Listen to the bass and drums)

2 - Something (Listen the bass, the drums, the orchestra, the vocals, the guitar solo)

1 - Here Comes The Sun (Guitar playing, lyrics, vocals, bass, moog, harmonies, orchestra, everything is perfect)

===

Aaaaand that's all!",2,1613414987
TheBeatles,lkj6xi,DaviAlfredo,1,Ranking The White Album songs,"Hello everyone! 

I'm a big fan of The Beatles, so today I chose one of their albuns, the self titled ""The Beatles"" (aka The White Album), and decided to rank all the songs, from worst to best.

This was really hard and, really, this list may change anytime. I really love all these tracks! Also I have some unpopular opinions, so some of these may surprise you. Anyways, here we go:

===

30 - Revolution 9 (Interesting and creppy. I like this experimental stuff, but overall I think it's too long)

29 - Julia (This song kinda bores me, but it's very interesting, and I love the lyrics)

28 - Wild Honey Pie (This one is very fun. It's very quick too, which works in it's favour. Overall a fun little tune)

27 - Helter Skelter (I like that intro and the backing vocals. The whole idea of a loud song is cool. But I just think it's kinda too long and all other songs are better)

26 - Good Night (This one has beautiful chord progressions and orchestration, but I kinda get bored by the middle)

25 - Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except Me And My Monkey (Very fun, bouncy and chaotic. A fun tune, sounds like a fun jam)

24 - Why Don't We Do It In The Road? (Great vocals, great introduction, great bass. A fun song, but I think maybe it should have had 1 or 2 more lines)

23 - Yer Blues (A great blues number, with great guitars, drumming and interesting lyrics)

22 - I Will (A fun little tune, with great chord progressions)

21 - Birthday (Fun all throughout! Great drumming, great guitar riffs and I especially love that ""I would like you to dance"" part)

20 - Savoy Truffle (Great fun as well! Great saxophones, great and playfull bass, great lyrics, and I love that chorus!)

19 - Piggies (Interesting chord progressions and well arranged. Sounds like a well arranged baroque type song. Also the lyrics are great)

18 - Don't Pass Me By (Ringo wrote a great song! Fun bass, fun piano, very interesting lyrics and concept. Overall a great song)

17 - Martha My Dear (I like this song a lot. It's very piano driven. Great melody and chord progreesions. I especially love that ""take a good look around you"" part)

16 - The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill (Fun song that changes between major and minor. Great flamenco start, interesting lyrics and a catchy chrous)

15 - Back In The U.S.S.R. (Catchy song, especially that guitar in the chorus. The drumming is very cool and the guitar solo is great. Also the backing vocals)

14 - Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da (A great and fun ska like number. Fun piano, fun melody. Great saxophones and that bass!)

13 - Long, Long, Long (I find this song to be very deep. It seems like a very personal song. It makes me emotional. I don't know, it just makes me feel stuff)

12 - Mother Nature's Son (Beatiful acoustic tune, especially that ""D D7M D7 G Gm D"" progression)

11 - Cry Baby Cry (Great song. I love that line cliche part, the bass, and all the little embelishments. Also I relate to the lyrics)

10 - Revolution 1 (A fun, bluesy tune. I especially love the ""shoo-be-doo-wah"" like parts)

9 - Glass Onion (Great references to other Beatles songs. Great drumming; the Sir George Martin's score also shines)

8 - Dear Prudence (Listen to the guitar and that bass. Enough said)

7 - I'm So Tired (Great feel, really works with the title of the song. Also that drumming)

6 - Rocky Raccoon (An extremely fun country number. Very story driven too; and what an interesting story! The honky-tonk piano solo also stands out. And that harmonica, so good!)

5 - Happiness Is A Warm Gun (Now we've reached the top 5. These 5 songs are incredibly good. This one in particular features a great guitar solo. The lyrics are very psychedelic, love it! The drumming on the chorus is amazing; that polyrhythm is fantastic)

4 - Sexy Sadie (The backing vocals, the chord progreesions, the piano, the lyrics, it's all there!)

3 - Honey Pie (An incredibly catchy music hall tune. The intro is fantastic; very well built, with great guitar embelishments. When the main part comes, the bass pops, the rhythm guitar dances troughout and where do I even begin with Sir George Martin's saxophones and clarinets score? Simply fabulous. The lyrics are also extremely fun. What a great song!)

2 - Blackbird (Do I even need to say anything?)

1 - While My Guitar Gently Weeps (Read the above)

===

Phew, that was a hard list to make! Overall, a great album! One of their best, in my opinion. It's varied, it's great, it flows, it's The Beatles!",7,1613412311

TheBeatles,lj1b4s,fp77,1,"Has Paul McCartney ever sung ""If I Fell"" in any of his concerts?","""If I Fell"" is probably one of my top 5 favorite songs of The Beatles. I've searched incessantly for live versions of Paul singing the song in his concerts. After all, it's a (almost) solely a Lennon composition, but Paul sings the main vocal part of the harmony. Besides, Paul has given a go to other songs in the past that were all Lennon (""Being for the Benefit of Mr Kite"", as an example). 

Has he never sang it live on any occasion since the days of the Beatles?",6,1613225806

Now, we're not just dealing with bad or uninteresting songs here; we're dealing with truly ridiculous material. Some of the cuts from Elvis' Greatest Shit include ""Dating"", ""There's No Room to Rhumba in a Sports Car"", and a live version of ""Are You Lonesome Tonight"" where everyone can't stop laughing - in other words, songs that have no merit to them besides some novelty.

There's something I've been thinking about for awhile now pertaining to our boys... is anyone else, or just me, shocked that they never took their own lives? Now I'm not trying to stir up any debates on if it's ever a moral or just or rational thing to do, and I apolgize if I have triggered anything for anyone. Think about it for a few minutes though - they went slash have been through many events in their lives that were are tramatic, emotional, life changing, and just plain stressful (losing loved ones, death threats, divorce, the media constantly harrassing and judging them, addiction, mental illness, physical illness, etc...) Not to mention all of the lies, half-truths, and rumors that they heard since dealt with, with some being just plain evil and vile. Add on all of the musicians who have gone through these things and have taken their own lives (Kurt Cobain, Avicii, Elliott Smith, Chris Cornell, Chester Bennington, etc...) I personally am pretty dumfounded that none of the Beatles ever ended it, especially Paul and Ringo since they've lived the longest (Heather Mills lies of abuse anyone?)

I made a playlist from the tape and all of the songs are in the right order. Is there anybody that could tell me if it is an existing album OR if it for sure is a self made playlist? It would really mean a lot to me to know.

I'm thrilled to be hosting a livestream panel discussion with three of John Lennon's old friends. It's happening this Friday night, 8PM Eastern US time (that's 12pm the next day for me here in Australia).

Featured in the livestream panel will be Dan Richter (longtime friend of both John &amp; Yoko), Jon Cobert (member of John’s backing band, BOMF) and Ivor Davis (correspondent on the 1964/65 Beatles US tours). They each have some fascinating stories to tell, from meeting Elvis with the Beatles, to performing with John in the seventies, to wrestling with Phil Spector backstage at Madison Square Garden.

TheBeatles,l4tipo,jeopardyman,1,Many weeks of Beatles discussion coming up at r/52WeeksOfMusic,"Hi everybody! 

/r/52WeeksOfMusic has been tackling the new year by listening to three albums per week, each from a year of music, progressing chronologically. We're now in week 4 dedicated to three releases from 1966, including Revolver! (bet you can guess the other two). We just wrapped up Rubber Soul and A Hard Day's Night in Weeks 3 and 2, respectively. 

Would love for this sub to contribute their thoughts to the discussion, even to the old threads. You can find all our discussions so far here: 

[*A Hard Day's Night*](https://www.reddit.com/r/52WeeksOfMusic/comments/kurmfc/week_2_jan_1016_discussion_thread_on_196064/) 

[*Rubber Soul*](https://www.reddit.com/r/52WeeksOfMusic/comments/kznctm/week_3_jan_1723_discussion_thread_on_1965/)

[*Revolver*](https://www.reddit.com/r/52WeeksOfMusic/comments/l4ga14/week_4_jan_2430_discussion_thread_on_1966/) 

And we have Pepper's, White Album, and Abbey Road on the menu for the coming weeks. You can see the schedule for the whole year [here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/52WeeksOfMusic/comments/kp0hyd/52_weeks_of_music_master_album_thread/)

I couldn't find this on Deezer and I heard it wasn't available on Spotify either.
I did find the exact song but by Billy J. Kramer. Has anybody heard of it and does anyone know what happened to it?
Also, I just started learning to play the guitar and I'd love to know the chords that The Beatles used for this song, does anybody know a site, app or document through which you can find out chords used? Or does anybody simply know which chords were used?
Sorry for my many questions, I just love the song so much and I'd love to learn more about it.",0,1611495881

I would add ""Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except Me And My Mokey"" because I feel it very similar to ""Why Don't We Do It In The Road?"", but I guess everyone would select it and that's not my point. I would also add ""Carnival Of Light"" as a joke, but I think a lot of people would select it as a joke or because they can't decide between these three v.
