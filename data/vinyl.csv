vinyl,,The Cinematic Orchestra - Ma Fleur (released 15 years ago üéÇ),1651958798,ukmt5l
vinyl,"On 7th May 2007, The Cinematic Orchestra released Ma Fleur, I remembered being excited for this album. During the early 2000's, Ninja Tune was one of my top labels with albums by Mr Scruff, Herbaliser, DJ Vadim, DJ Food and by extension, Roots Manuva, Ty all getting heavy rotation. The album which I played the most and for about 1 year, every morning before I got out of bed, was The Cinematic Orchestra - Everyday.

Everything about that album vibed with me. The breakbeat/hip hop/jazz drum patterns, the vocalists, how they go from contemporary pop type songs like All That You Give/Everyday to mad instrumentals like Flite and the latter half of All Things To All Men. So, I was pretty hyped for Ma Fleur.

So, when I bought it and gave it a listen, I was pretty disappointed, the whole album was phrased differently. It was more abstract with building orchestral parts, less jazz/pop hooks but I kept listening to it on repeat and I'm glad it did as it's a beautiful piece which takes you on a journey and washes this sound and space over you. 

Genuinely one of my favourite albums and I was glad to see them play it like at The Roundhouse in Camden a few years later.",The Cinematic Orchestra - Ma Fleur (15 years old todayüéÇ),1651958711,ukms5q

I'd guess that their best known releases are the Hillbillies in Hell compilations--13 volumes of fantastic, mostly little known country sides that deal in murder, betrayal, etc. They have a few single artist compilations but the majority are old country comps. My favorite reissue label, and that's saying something these days. Unfortunately, they don't seem to have any web presence whatsoever, and I generally have to find out about their releases via Light in the Attic (their distributor). Sadly, I didn't find out about the Hillbillies in Hell series until they were already up to vol. 9, and the first eight are way out of my price range.

vinyl,"Been lurking in this sub for years but then stopped even coming for a while because I just didn't see enough of what I was into on here.  So instead of complaining to myself, I decided to just start posting.  I started off buying classic rock stuff like alot of the people on the sub which quickly turned into trying to find my favorite hip-hop samples.  Now I'm mainly into Jazz-Funk-Soul-World stuff.  Here are a few records that I've picked up recently.

Gary Saracho- En Medio: Only record this guy put out.  Latin Psychedelic Jazz Funk.  It's really all over the place.. Favorite Track: ""Senor Baker""

Sunzoh Ohno- Bubbles: Japanese trumpet based Jazz with one track heavy Jazz-Funk.  Beautiful record front to back but Fav Track is the super funky ""Don't Get Down"".

Dom Um Romao- Spirit of the Times: Brazilian Jazz/Jazz-Funk/ Bossa Nova.  Dom is a drummer and percussionist which us why the album is really percussion heavy.  My fav fav track is the tune- ""Lamento Negro"".

Billy Foster and the Audio-  Private Press 80's boogie and Jazz funk.  It's soooooo good.  Entire album is a banger.  If you can only listen to one, check out Sometimes.  

Music Inc-  I am not as high on the Strata East label as others are.  Not really a big free jazz guy.  I like the idea of it, but it just isn't for me.  I digress.  This album is Hard Bop meets Modal jazz with some big band backings.  Really good with some really good jazz players on this album.  Check out ""Abscretions"".

Dave Pike- On a Gentle Note:  Dave Pike is a renowned Vibraphone player.  Have some of his other albums where it's more straight forward jazz that has a worldly flair to it.  Didn't know this album existed till recently.  It's all jazz funk ala Roy Ayers. Basically it's exactly the album I wanted him to make with out knowing he actually made it. Check out the first track ""Lazy Afternoon"".

&amp;#x200B;

If you made it this far hopefully you found some new music to check out.  Yes I know my Pics sucked, I'll do better next time, I promise.","Didn't see what I was into, so figured I'd post.",1651923876,ukbkg4

This album takes the template laid by Levitate and makes it into a much more satisfying and muscular release, imho. First thing: Mark E. Smith's vocals are much clearer and his lyrics more complex than the cryptic snatches and repeated rants from the latter album. And the actual songwriting itself seems somehow more ""mature""; songs are actually arranged with flair and the covers on this are fucking brilliant--the scuzz-rockabilly of ""F-oldin' Money"" by Tommy Blake, ""This Perfect Day"" by The Saints and ""Bound"" by The Audio Arts. Bangers all.  
The sheer sonic attack of some of the hard breakbeat/nascent D&amp;B tracks on this LP are much more concentrated and less ""spread about"" than same on Levitate. ""Anecdotes And antidotes In B#"" is an utterly RINSED ""hard Breakbeat""/proto-junglist masterpiece and a total highlight...But one of my favourite, and certainly most surprising cuts on the LP is the final track ""On My Own"". A kind of Italio-Piano House track completely missing any beats whatsoever--the only rhythm occurring due to a wonderfully rolling, almost naked piece of aforementioned Piano House...I would never in a million years have thought I would enjoy what is basically beat-less Italian Disco-House but the beautifully rolling changes of these piece, along with MES's sympathetic vocal performance which just ""rrollls along"" with the instrumental track make this one of my favourite final tracks on any Fall studio LP. Just, fucking brilliant.  
Oh, and extra kudos for the absolutely heavy ""MES IN DUB"" track known as ""Finale: Tom Raggazzi"". Here Smithy acquits himself pretty damn fucking well with an attempt at ""ragga"" style Jamaican toasting...without sounding trite like String, Boy George, Snow or any of the other never-ending litanies of white men appropriating reggae vocal stylings....if anything he sounds closer to KRS-ONE circa Ghetto MUsic: The Blueprint (and that's no small fucking praise!)  
If you can pick this up for a good price then you're in for a treat and a fucking half. If not then buy the CD (but NOT the second LP pressing!!!)  
The production punch and ""polished"" songcraft of The Unutterable, the songwriting adventurousness of Levitate mulched together in this absolute masterpiece. Savage garage-rockabilly, unprecedented, muscularly-produced breakbeat/junglist/drum n' bass and fucking RAGGA combined with Italio-house stylings (and some kitchen sink but not as much as featured in Levitate!)  make The Marshall Suite one of the total highpoints of several latter-period Fall trilogies as good as ANYTHING the group ever released. A loud, crunching, wonderful continuation of it's predecessor, again built upon by the low-slung chugging pro-tools bass loops and psychobilly of The Unutterable.   


Gimme Levitate to The Unutterable. Gimme The REal New Fall LP to Imperial Wax Solvent--Heck!-give me Reformation! to Re-Mit!   
But The Marshall Suite is a DOUBLE-BASTARD of an LP and will make your life as a Fall fan immeasurably better!

vinyl,"Ok, so on RSD I picked up a copy of the Howard Wales release. Took it home and a few days later played it for the first time. It had a pretty bad warp to it causing the needle to move right to left and causing warbling sound. 

So I took it back and asked if they would mind exchanging it since they still had a copy. They took a look, kinda gave me the stink eye for inconveniencing them, and then realized the record was in fact pretty bad, so they exchanged it. As a sign of good faith and my appreciation, I even picked up another record while I was there, the recent rerelease of the Grateful Dead's Skull and Roses LP. 

Took it home, put it on the TT for a spin, and whaddya know, there's a nice deep scratch about a half inch long on sides C and D, causing about 3 minutes of popping on each side. So I packed it up, and brought it back the next day. 

Here's where it gets a little dicey. The owner of the shop immediately starts giving me shit. Talking about how he can't just send back faulty merchandise to the manufacturer, and that he takes the hit for every purchase returned. Which is fair, I get it. It sucks. At the same time though, I told him that I just don't see how that's my problem considering he sold me messed up records. 

He said something along the lines of ""well one return is one thing, but two returns on two days is a pattern"" and I was just gobsmacked. I asked him if he thinks I warped the first record in the 48 hours that I owned it, just to return it, while laughing a bit, not gonna lie. 

We were both pretty calm and polite and stuff during the interaction, it's not like we were yelling at eachother, but it's like, am I wrong here? The Dead record was $45. I feel like I shouldn't have to just suck up the cost just because I feel bad for those dudes small business. We ended up meeting in the middle and he exchanged it for a slightly cheaper record, but the whole thing left a really bad taste in my mouth.

They're not hugely well known outside of their home country, but man does this shit slap hard - epic guitar riffs, hard driving bass, and some otherworldly vocals. 

They're definitely a mood spin, and as I prep for too many work meetings, I find myself spinning this record, letting the walls shake, and the sweet warping whines of amped up guitars reverberate. 

Here's a link to some info on the bad: [https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3jebe/psych-supergroup-mooner-debuts-with-a-stunning-music-video-as-heavy-and-trippy-as-their-sound](https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3jebe/psych-supergroup-mooner-debuts-with-a-stunning-music-video-as-heavy-and-trippy-as-their-sound)

Best of all, their vinyl is relatively undiscovered but still in press - so you can pick it up nice and cheap. A bargain for the epic nature of their tunes. 

I can only hope they will play live on the East Coast sometime so I can rock out to them live.

I also have 20th century stuff.

vinyl,,My mom's co-worker gifted me an entire collection for free. Here are the highlights!,1651470078,ugimhl
vinyl,"I‚Äôm going to take a wild guess and say my story not unique. I‚Äôll start by saying I don‚Äôt think of myself as an audiophile or even an avid hobbyist. In a way I‚Äôve just been accumulating ;)

As a pre-preteen I bought 2 things with babysitting money: Blue Cheer‚Äôs Summertime Blues 7‚Äù, and Moody Blues‚Äô Days of Future Passed (&amp; later Every Good Boy, destroyed by my sister). Later I bought or was gifted an album here and there, like Born to Run, and Tomita‚Äôs Snowflakes are Dancing. My boyfriend at the time made a turntable for me and gave me some old speakers and a receiver from his band. 

It wasn‚Äôt until after I came home from 1-1/2 years in England, heard some great non-AOR music, and had my own little paycheck that I started building a collection. A boyfriend from that time convinced me to buy some new components, and I still have most of those decades later, today: an SL-D1 turntable, a Marantz tape deck, and my Technics box speakers. 

A little later my friends and yet another boyfriend went into NY almost every weekend to Sounds (St. Marks) digging through the bins. I have so many records still with that big red circle price sticker on the cover. After Sounds, we‚Äôd go kind of around the corner to a step-down shop that had an Amazing collection of punk &amp; obscure 7‚Äù, like Justin Love/Trouble, TSOL, March Violets, etc. One of our friends was a DJ at The Meadowbrook, and we‚Äôd go early to help him unload the milk cartons, so I also developed an early love for extended version 12‚Äù, especially after he started playing more and more reggae before the club opened. We all had similar but different tastes, so after buying records we‚Äôd hang out and play a couple from everybody‚Äôs haul, sitting in thick smoke and seeing if any secret messages were etched in the runouts lol. We made a lot of straight and mixed tapes for each other with all this stuff. Some paper inner sleeves that I kept had ‚ÄúMixed tapes are killing music‚Äù printed on them. 

A year or so ago I got a new cartridge (red 2M). Recently I re-designed my whole audio/visual setup to have everything more accessible. This year I got a new low-end Sony receiver and new spool of all-copper speaker wires. I was choice-limited by the combo of budget and needing a phono line accepting bare wires. My LPs have almost always been on a Hejne (Ikea) shelf unit. Originally taking up 4 shelves snugly, now down to 3-1/2 after a donation about 10 years ago. 

Right now I‚Äôm going through all of them again, doing a wet cleaning by hand. I‚Äôm also playing them as I go, rediscovering why I bought them in the first place. As I listen I‚Äôm also grateful that I always took care of my records, thanks to that first boyfriend who made a turntable for me and taught me how to handle them, and that my mother was wrong to stack 4 albums at a time. I still have my original Discwasher (fluid is long gone). During my heavy-buying phase, I also bought a lot of VRP inner sleeves. 

Sometimes, just curious, I go on discogs to see if anyone else values something as much as I do. Someone was selling a Yellowman album that I have, for over $400, which seems absolutely wild to me. This sub is great for looking at the covers and maybe going down a rabbit hole on a recommendation.

I see new people joining this glorious hobby everyday and they immediately get dumped on because they didnt buy the right turntable or they only listen to mainstream music or they posted a picture of a new album and that album gets posted about everyday. But it's new to them. They are excited about it . It means something to them.

I am not sure why we aren't more welcoming. Gatekeeping is for a$$holes. I personally want vinyl to thrive even more than it is. My wife's children listen to vinyl because of me and I want their kids to listen to Vinyl because of them.

It seems odd, as it takes five seconds to take a picture with a phone, and the fact that it's somewhat rare and, for me, relatively expensive, makes my request seem completely ordinary.

vinyl,"I got serious about collecting vinyl in the beginning of 2018, and am currently sitting at around 250 records with a smaller cassette collection on the side. Nothing crazy, but enough. I'm passionate about music first and foremost, I love the ""hands on"" aspect with each record and have gotten so much enjoyment from it. I've accumulated a diverse collection with some pretty rare gems and timeless classics. To this minute it's one of my favorite and most rewarding hobbies, but I realized recently that I'm at a crossroad for where I go with collecting vinyl. Ever since the pandemic substantially encouraged and contributed to FOMO in an already competitive resale market my collection according to discogs has appreciated in value to the price of a used car. For a handful of reasons, that *pisses me off.* 


It's nothing new to anyone that mainstream albums are OOP due to supply chain issues, but seeing endless flippers immediately buy up restocks to make a profit off of someone who missed the opportunity to buy something at MSRP or on RSD has always left such a bad taste in my mouth, and it's made me subconsciously paranoid when I use my own records to where I find myself thinking ""don't damage it, I don't want to pay a flipper to replace it."" Because I've done just that, dropped a generic repress I bought for $40 only two months ago that's now selling for double at the minimum. With my more rare &amp; limited records that sense increases even further to where it takes away the enjoyment of the music a lot of the time (I maintain the philosophy to listen to everything in my collection no matter the value however). Looking at my records overall just sitting on a shelf is becoming somewhat of a mental burden anymore when I think about the ""what if?"" scenarios of it getting damaged in a natural disaster, by a four-legged friend, a future kid, someone vengeful, etc. never mind the objective fact it's an absolute PITA to move between living spaces and take care of.


What got me thinking on all of this was trading in about two dozen records a few weeks ago and how good it felt to get them out of the way. One side of me wants to continue my love of music by collecting more records despite the cons, enjoying the sentimentality associated with getting each one, yet another side of me would find it very freeing to not have to have them weigh me down literally and figuratively anymore. I'm curious to what peoples' thoughts and experiences are with selling off whole collections because it's gotten to a point where simplifying life has becoming very appealing.",I'm getting increasingly jaded with collecting vinyl and having thoughts about selling my collection,1651356319,ufl85j

did use the search, also had a read on Google and now equipped with the research I have reached some conclusions, but I would love if some more experienced users could please verify if I got it correct:

1) vinyl vs CD sound quality - not better, but different. Vinyl contains a fuller spectrum of sound but introduces noise and CDs have much less noise but cut off certain frequencies. Is that correct?
2) in order to get a sound as true to the actual performance of the artist, I should be looking for vinyls that came out before the digitalisation of the industry, because the chances are modern re-issues are just new pressings of the digitalised (flattened spectrum) tracks
3) vinyl records and produces a continuous sound wave vs CDs and digital in general ‚Äúchop‚Äù the wave at 44.1 kHz - kinda like frames per second in a movie - therefore vinyl  will contain a truer representation of the recording provided it was mastered for the vinyl not digitally

I am not an audiophile and I can‚Äôt hear those differences but I would like to get ‚Äúas close to the artist‚Äù as possible. I mostly listen to swing / jazz.

vinyl,"New-ish to collecting vinyl, like so many people in the last 3-5 years.  Lately, I‚Äôve been ultra curious about the inner workings of how the supply chain works - how records get selected to be pressed, how rights work, how distribution works, etc.  Does anyone have insider insight into the process of how records get selected to be pressed and how they eventually make it into stock?

The reason I ask - the first record I bought was in 2017, the OkNotOk version of Ok Computer.  It was everywhere.  Now, 5 years later, it‚Äôs sold out everywhere because demand is up - but occasionally, I‚Äôve seen it pop up in limited restocks.  Where are these copies coming from?  Are they leftover copies that have been sitting at a distributor for this long and they are slowly seeing the light of day?  Or are they new pressings?

Taking another Radiohead example - Pablo Honey, which is an album that was also everywhere back in 2017, was sold out in a lot of places recently.  Again, due to increased demand, I get that.  But all of a sudden, there was a surge of restocks in much greater quantities than OkNotOk.  I assume this was a large scale repress and the market got flooded with a bunch of new copies?

Then, taking a different example - Blink-182‚Äôs self titled album is very hard to find lately, and I don‚Äôt recall seeing many of them even back before the surge.  I‚Äôve found all their other albums recently, but self-titled seems to be one that is not getting repressed.  Is this a rights issue?  Basically, if this record would sell super fast if it came back in stock, why isn‚Äôt it getting a repress?  Is it purely that records like Pablo Honey got in the queue ahead of Blink 182 and there‚Äôs a huge backup?

And then, what determines when something gets a repress vs. a full reissue?  Obviously anniversary releases with additional content or a full remastering makes sense.  But why do we often see record companies doing a reissue when something could just be repressed from the same masters?

This is a pretty far out longshot but wondering if people could help me out. I am looking for some ideas on bookshelf stoppers as I don't own that many vinyls and hate when they fall over.

Last year work got in the way, so I picked up AK3 ""From Here to Infirmary"" from ebay for $42 (all-in).

I just bought Everlast's WFSTB for $37 from ebay.  I'm good

How much do the flippers really make here?

Honestly its not worth my time to get in line and wait.

I support my local shops, all day.  but how much did these records cost?

Is it worth it for flippers to gobble them up to make $8, $10?

I'm good.  I know I missed out on getting a chance to flip a Tay-Tay record for $125, but at the end of the day I would rather see Taylor Swift fans get the records they were waiting for and is it worth it to flip all these other records?

I plan on upgrading my Denon 2310 to a Denon X3400H for my cinema/music setup (Elac B6 for speakers).   
Currently I can plug in my  ITT HiFi 9610 turntable directly into the phono output, sadly the X3400H doesn't have a phono input. I read a few things about connecting a turntable to a non-phono input receiver and I'm completely lost, partially because of the preamp and the normal amp and partially because there is no information about the turntable (to find out if it has a (pre)amp). 

Can someone tell me what I need to buy to connect my turntable to the new receiver? It doesn't need to be top of the line hardware at all, I rather have a cheaper (pre)amp, but of course it should deliver quite nice/good quality sound (about what I had when it was connected to the Denon 2310).   
What do I need to buy/what do you recommend?

Thanks all in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

vinyl,"A few months ago I inquired if anyone had any information about the differences between the mono and stereo recordings of early exotica albums. Since then I‚Äôve done some more digging and found some spicy info regarding Capitol Record‚Äôs recording process around 1956 - 1958, when stereo was still in its infancy, but quickly becoming popular. At this time, Capitol Record‚Äôs method of recording mono was, if you would pardon my French, some real serious shit. They would use close-mic techniques with eight microphones/channels during a recording session to capture every nuance of a performance. This is why Capitol‚Äôs albums in the 50s have such a ""rich"" sound. Starting in 1956, they began casting caution to the goddamn wind and started simultaneously hanging two or three mics overhead for their stereo releases. So basically, they were recording one session using two very different methods, and releasing two very different sounding versions of an album‚Äì a more defined, intimate mono release, and a more ambient and sweeping stereo release. Les Baxter‚Äôs sessions for¬† ‚ÄúPorts of Pleasure,‚Äù ‚ÄúSpace Escapade,‚Äù ‚ÄúSouth Pacific,‚Äù and ‚ÄúAfrican Jazz‚Äù were all recorded in this fashion. Most of these albums can be found for five bucks, and I recommend picking them up and hearing the differences for yourself. For me, it has been fun comparing them. I‚Äôm sure Liberty and other labels were doing something similar at the time, and I‚Äôll be picking up some more mono and stereo versions of Martin Denny to compare soon. I could go on and on about this but nobody has time for that. Have a great Monday everyone.",Exotica: Mono vs. Stereo: The Return,1650884932,ubills

vinyl,"My one complaint about RSD is how they're pricing 2-LP sets as if they're 2 individual records (going for around a $25-$28 price point). So close to or above $50 for a 2-record set (such as the Stones-More Hot Rocks which was around $60). But having worked in several record stores years ago I can attest that wasn't how 2LP sets were priced. They were only SLIGHTLY higher than single albums (with rare exceptions like Pink Floyd The Wall &amp; Zep-Physical Graffiti which were priced based on their demand &amp; also having 2 full volumes of great material musically..also the packaging). This especially applied to live albums. So for example Rush-Moving Pictures may have been $7.99-$8.99 but then Exit..Stage Left was priced around $11.99 being a live double-album.

It's mostly price gouging. From the top down. They were gouging pre-covid/shortages. It's also the fact they no longer MASS produce vinyl on a scale they did back before CDs took over. That was how Tower Records &amp; chains like them existed. They used to move massive volumes of vinyl every week. You'd walk in there and there were stacks &amp; stacks of just NEW releases every week. And people were going through them like they were at a discount flea market grabbing as much as they could afford.

RSD is basically that, but on a much smaller scale, catering to a more selective &amp; eclectic clientele",RSD pricing,1650774117,uammrc

Trouble is I bought the album on vinyl back in 2009 and the mix is godawful. It sounds like every song was produced by a different person, the highs and lows are over the map. Some songs are fine but certain ones sound completely blown out and muddy to the point of distraction. It never goes on my turntable because it‚Äôs just sonically wretched.

I noticed on discogs that there is a 2019 reissue (on sexy colored vinyl to boot!)‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I was wondering if anyone has listened to this version. Was it remixed/remastered? How‚Äôs the sound. If its any better I‚Äôm planning to swap my copy, but if it‚Äôs the same then I won‚Äôt bother.

vinyl,"Hi Everyone! 

I‚Äôve had a Mary Ann record player from auna for about a year and a half now, and from day one I had issues with what I think is sibilance. Basically on hard ‚ÄòS‚Äô and ‚ÄòT‚Äô sounds or on heavy symbol crashes, I get a scratchy or staticky noise out of the speakers. This doesn‚Äôt happen when I use the BT or CD function on it. 

It has improved the more I use it, but still features regularly on some of my records, regardless of whether they‚Äôre second hand or not. Was wondering if this is a common or uncommon issue, or if there‚Äôs any ways I can fix or improve the sound? 

I‚Äôve already replaced the needle on it, but that didn‚Äôt do much at the time. I‚Äôve read somewhere before that it could be an issue with the cartridge, but I‚Äôm not sure if I can replace the one I have, and if I can what I should replace it with.

Any help or advice is more than welcome!
Here‚Äôs a link to the model I have: https://www.hifi-tower.ie/Mary-Ann-Turntable-33-45-78-rpm-CD-DAB-FM-BT-USB-Black-Grey.html?listtype=search&amp;searchparam=auna%20Mary%20Ann

But recently i've been wanting to get back into it and honestly, it's not really a sound thing for me. I collected because of my deep love of music and i enjoyed investing my money into it. I also like the idea of having a library of my favorite music out on display. 

Only thing that's been kind of holding me back is that i've noticed that everything has gone up since i've been gone. I used Amazon a lot to buy my records back then, and when i look at the same records now, some have gone up almost 3 times in price or it seems a lot of the albums i once had are now harder to find. 

So i'm kind of kind of hesitate...but i'm still leaning towards the ""do it"" side of things. I was thinking of just getting a few essential albums i like and waiting for things to drop hopefully.",Thinking about Getting Back Into Vinyl.,1650696873,u9zhps

vinyl,"I wanted to give everyone my review of Atlanta record stores in order to help guide any future travelers! If you‚Äôre currently living in Atlanta, GA, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on my review.

Obvious preface: Every shopper is different with different needs, wants, and desires! OK, now that we've got the obvious out of the way...

I visited a good amount of record stores over 2 days.

I scout out for good deals on generally used rock of all types. Honestly, super wide tastes from anything from Beach Boys, to Black Sabbath, to Oingo Boingo, to Harry Nilsson, to Kraftwerks. Maybe a little basso nova Jazz mixed in.

I will grade stores on 3 important criteria based on the records I generally look for:

Price. The standard bearer of price is discogs. A business being most fair to you is selling a record based on on historical data. A business being slightly less fair (but acceptable IMO) is selling a record for a current equivalent price on discogs. A business being an arsehole is by selling you a record that is higher than equivalent record and sprinkling more on top.

Selection. No one wants to walk into a record store and find nothing. Since I am a used buyer, it‚Äôs important to have a nice used selection that is being refreshed at a usual cadence. I typically will avoid stores that focus only on new records, especially the common variety.

Suave. Just the overall atmosphere. Cool people working? Nice music playing? Cool posters? Serve beer? Just a cool place to be while you browse?

Here we go!

&amp;#x200B;

Decator

Wuxtry

I would say this shop has mostly used records. There's a wall behind the counter of higher value records that appeared to be a bit over priced. I think I remember seeing ""The Who - Who's Next"" for $50 (or maybe it was $80). There was another one up there too (I think it was Sticky Fingers for $100).

Price: C+. Prices were generally comparable to current discogs listings but with shipping included in the price. The high value records appeared to be even more overpriced. Inflated prices, for sure.

Selection: B. Records felt a little picked through, not containing very many, if at all of more common bigger hitter rock records. The only thing I found was a Harry Nillson album that I was missing for about $10. 

Suave: B. I was one of the first to enter the store with two employees so I didn't get to listen to any tunes. It's pretty jammed packed with records in there, but lots of low-end variety.

Total records purchased: 1

Ella Guru

This was instantly better than Wuxtry. Smaller selection and store, but everything is far more curated. You get a sense of what's there is all good. This would be the store I would visit weekly due to price and selection.

Price: B+. Prices were generally spot on to discogs minus shipping. I found a VG+ - NM TML pressing of the Wall for $30 (the nicest OG press I have ever seen). Got a superb copy of Michael Jackson's Thriller for $20, and a really nice copy of Strange Days for $15. These are just solid prices and also solid records.

Selection: B. Their selection is limited, but as mentioned it's curated. Nothing crappy goes in there. They even had a copy of ""The Who - Who's Next"" (which is not as common as I'd hope) for about $10 or so, but condition was a little under what I would have liked.

Suave: A. Cool atmosphere, cool music, clean store, and a really nice owner. I liked him so much I sold him some records before I left.

Total records purchased: 4.

&amp;#x200B;

Criminal Records

This is probably the most popular store in Atlanta. There's usually a line to be able to go inside. The store has tons of incredible flair. This is obviously where the largest Record Store Days events happen. This is the place to go if you're looking for new records. Used records? Read on...

Price: C+. I could not gauge used prices since I couldn‚Äôt find anything used that I knew about. It seems like used prices are a bit inflated, but not astronomically so. Pricing for new records are typically a little over Amazon or whatever. That's common for many stores. 

Selection: D. This is not the place to go for Used records as the new records overpower the used record selection by 4:1. You basically have a small selection on the far end of the store to look through, and man I flipped through everything since I really wanted to find something.  I suppose if you're after used and if you lived close by, you can bounce in from time to time and maybe find something, but this is definitely not my type of record store.

Suave: A. Definitely the ""fanciest"" record store of them all. Tons of flair posted about. Some cool display cases of higher value records. Lots of posters and what-not to buy.

Wax N' Facts

Right around the corner from Criminal is Wax N' Facts. They have TONS of records (most of them are not going to be sleeved). The vast majority of records are going to be low value records however, so if you're after higher hitters (think Black Sabbath, Queen, or the likes) then you're really not going to find much here. However, if you're after stuff that isn't of high value, but maybe just hard to locate, this may be the perfect store for you. It's a big, musty record store with tons to look through!

Price: A. Records are superbly priced. I found a brand new Nilsson album for $12 in shrink. Prices on everything here is typically discogs minus shipping and I'm sure there's quite a few examples of even cheaper than that.

Selection: C+. Selection is tough to rate for this store since my list had stuff like ""Oingo Boingo"" on it and some harder to find Beach boys stuff. I just couldn't find much in here. They don't have a high-value selection either, so you really just have to dig and hope for the best. Lots of ""dad rock"" stuff like ""BTO"" and ""Three Dog Night"" stuff all over the damned place in here for a few bucks. If this is your dig, then you'd probably put an ""A"" here. I couldn't find any bossa nova jazz at all in here. I did however see someone infront of me find ""Beach Boys - Party!"" which was what I was looking for (and really difficult to find) so I was a bit bummed out on that! 

Suave: B+. It's a musty record store in a really cool location, so what more can you want!

Buckhead

FantasyLand Records

Probably the largest record store in Atlanta. But largest doesn't mean best! I'm a bit torn how I feel about this store as I think they simply lack having quality records.

Price: C+ - B. Yes, I‚Äôm giving a range. I've seen examples of inflated pricing but also pretty decent priced stuff in value bins. I can't really gauge the price much because I couldn't find anything I wanted and I searched this store far and wide.

Selection: C. The store is so massive, and is filled with records. Rooms and rooms of them! The problem is that everything feels pretty picked through, and the vast majority are low-value records! As I mentioned, I had a large list of a wide variety stuff and this store had zero chance of providing anything for it. I ended up with a couple Soundtracks that were ""OK"" priced, but it was a chore even finding those. They didn't have a ""high value"" wall either. This store is similar to Wax N Facts in that the majority of records are low value stuff that require some digging. I did like how they seperate used vs new.

Suave: A. The owner is really nice and approachable. They had lots of beach boys playing, so it was kinda my type of store.

Marietta

Sweet Melissa Records

My most hated record store on my whole trip. The layout, organization, and cleanilness is incredible, but the prices are out of this world. This may have been the most expensive record store I have ever seen across 4 differents tates.

Price: F. Absolutely the highest prices in my trip. It is rare to find a low value record under $10 here. Prices were Dicogs + Shipping + 40% on top. 

Selection: C+. They keep a bunch of low value records. I absolutely couldn't find anything on my list (I keep bringing up ""my list"" but I have about 35 records on my list, all 70s-80s stuff which shouldn't be hard to find in a place like this). No black sabbath, no Stan Getz of any sort, no Kraftwork, no Motley Crue, no Queen, etc). The only cool thing I found in there is they had 8 autographed Ry Cooder albums, but get this: $80 each. They are absolutely nuts.

Suave: C. I think it's cool that they have equipment that they sell (that seems reasonable priced) and they seem to be the place to go if you're wanting to get into ways of listening to records. They seem like really nice people and there was always some good music playing. But it really just doesn't shake them being an extremely overpriced antique store. 

Total Records purchased: 0. Looked and got the hell out of there.

&amp;#x200B;

The Battery

Waterloo Sunset

One of my favorite record stores. I stayed right next to it so I visited 3 times. Everything about this store is a good example of what a record store should have.

Price: B+. Prices were very comparable to current Discogs. I picked up Yes Time and a Word for $15, a hard to find Nilsson album for $9, American Pop Soundtrack for $7, and an Astrud Gilberto album for $6. I also picked up a new Ry Cooder live album for $15. No inflation going on here, prices being sold pretty much right at Discogs value (without shipping). It's incredible that they price things solid like this being in the Battery.

Selection B+: While the used rock and used Jazz isn't ""huge"", they seem to get stuff in every single day so the used bins are great to check. Their new selection isn't half-bad either and I like that they separate used vs new. You're bound to find something in here. They actually have a small japanese and Mofi section, so really huge bonus!

Suave: B+. Just a solid record store with great music, a nice workers  that just lets you browse and enjoy yourself. They even gave me a tour. Hard to not like this place.

Total Records purchased: 5

I also went to the atlanta record show and picked up several things there that you will see included in the photo below.

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully this helps any future travelers or even any locals! My favorite stores are Ella Guru and Waterloo Sunset.

my plan is too arrive at 5:30 with the intent to pick up a copy, is this too late? should i be there earlier? 
i believe as long as my place in the queue doesn‚Äôt exceed 80, my odds are really good?

i also know the demand is high for this item, and i‚Äôm concerned i should be factoring the possibility that people will be there just for the item, and they‚Äôll come down to my store because they have so many copies.

vinyl,"Wilco announced a massive 11 LP box set for Yankee Hotel Foxtrot packed w/ demos and filler

Beastie Boys are releasing a 4 LP boxset packed w/ demos and filler.

Nirvana seems to pump out a similar box every year...

These are just a couple of examples of what is becoming a de facto move for all legacy acts and ""classic"" albums.

I've said it before and I'll keep saying it. These bloated box sets (packed w/ unnecessary filler) from tired legacy acts are the reason pressing plants are so backed up and quality control is down. We can't complain about these pressing plant issues and clap like seals and drop coin every time a new one is announced.

I love these albums as much as the next person, but it's reaching a point of excess that is just silly and dumb. Wouldn't it make more sense to put all those demos, b-sides and live tracks on like a jump drive or a CD instead. That way pressing plants can prioritize other releases that are worthy of the format.

vinyl,"I've noticed listening to music on vinyl that there seems to be more real silence in between all of the possible isolated sounds. In between snare hits I hear a natural studio reverberation in the silence .. I do not necessarily believe VINYL sounds better than properly engineered digital audio, but there is a certain quality to it that I can pick up on - the natural reverberation heard in the silence being one of them. I think with a digital ""compressed"" copy, the same silence (and any natural reverberation within it) would be lost because it would be beneath a certain threshold, a threshold that does not exist on an analog recording with deeper room for even the most subtle waveforms to be heard. 

So this is just my take I'm wondering if anyone else has similar thoughts?",The silence in between sounds on vinyl,1650419716,u7lfhx

I need a copy of Bauhaus's Burning From The Inside, released in 1983.

More likely some later 80s reissue, VG conditions or so, you know. I might be able to find one of these for 20-30 ‚Ç¨ (I'm from Italy). 
Meanwhile, an official 2018 reissue campaign of their entire discography made available on any store these newly remastered records both on the music side and the graphic side, nicely too it seems. Prices go from 19 to 30 ‚Ç¨.

Basically the thing i've found online is this one record player that's for sale on the site i will put the link below. I'll also put a photo of the one being sold in this post.  


It would be awesome finding a manual for it but unfortunately i haven't found it online, and i think my dad bought it used, so it probably didn't come with it.   


Lets see where this takes us :)

Unfortunately, the one i've got doesn't look this good, and it's missing the glass dust cover, but i think it has the potential of looking almost this good.

vinyl,"I was at my grandparents house the other day and ended up stumbling upon their old record player and their record collection. I decided to try playing one of them and it sounded incredibly good considering the player hasn‚Äôt been used in roughly 40 years. Anyway, at one point I was playing it at a slightly quieter volume and noticed that the sound was getting slightly distorted. I turned the volume down even more, and found that when the volume is at mute, the record is still playing through one channel and INCREDIBLY scratchy. It‚Äôs not noticeable at all when the record is being played at a normal volume but it still worries me that one of the channels is messed up like that. I‚Äôm a total noob when it comes to vinyl so I just want to know: Is this normal? Does it damage the record? And how can I fix it?

[Now playing: an original 1977 T-Neck\/CBS pressing of The Isley Brothers' 1977 masterpiece, Go for Your Guns.](https://preview.redd.it/b8oe02r6myt81.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d26459b8b58e1cb7d701e7f3b2b579160979774)

Many often cite The Isley Brothers solely as a soul and funk band. While there's no way to understate their impact as soul and funk masters, their roots have firmly been in rock &amp; roll since the late '50s (they're just as vital to shaping and shifting rock music than they're typically credited for -- so much so that there's still those that don't know pre-fame Jimi Hendrix was once the featured guitarist in their band.) By the time this album came out, the Isleys underwent several reinventions and proved their staying power as soul-funk hitmakers, but they also had Ernie Isley in the fold. An all-time underrated great whose guitar wizardry summoned a brew of Jimi Hendrix's Black psychedelic magic, Eddie Hazel's freewheeling funk ferocity, and the bluesy wails of B.B. King, Buddy Miles, and Albert King, Ernie showed all his cards all over this album (even going so far as playing all the drums.) The result was a faultless gem of late-period psychedelic soul, which boasted tough funk-rock built around baby brother Marvin Isley's hefty speaker-rumbling slap bass and a pair of all-time boudoir soul classics, including the greatest song ever written about infidelity, ""Footsteps in the Dark"" and the mystical prog-soul epic, ""Voyage to Atlantis.""

When they were stored in PVC sleeves for 20+ years and smell horribly like a beachball, (no visual or audible problems to the record whatsoever tho) am I okay if I just exchange the PVC sleeves with Poly ones and put them on my shelf or should I be worried that the smelly outer jacket could leech onto other records on the shelf?  I am also worried about putting these records through my degritter as the actual record itself smells as well and I don‚Äôt want it to contaminate my other records as they share the same water.

vinyl,"Hey! 

  
My band received test presses today and we were quite shocked at how different it sounded depending on the turntable.  


The first one we tried (Belt-drive) the pitch was really lower and tempo was quite slower (5-10 bpm slower per songs than the original recording). We thought there was a problem with the pressing.  


Then we tried on a different belt-drive at a friends place. The tempo was much better, but just a little bit faster than the original recording. We didn't know what to think anymore about the pressing and were quite confused.  


Than we tried on a 3rd turntable - a direct drive. And everything was perfect.  
Does this mean that the direct drives are much more reliable ? That the belt drive were just setup the wrong way ?

Currently have Edifier R1700BTs that I've been running from my AudioTechnica 120. I just nabbed a Monoprice pure tube amp and want to get more out of it all.

In my limited knowledge, I'm leaning toward Emotiva B1s, because I'm running a full 5.1 with that brand with my home theater (and svs pb-1000). But, my audiophile/engineer friend runs KRK Rokits for his work, and obviously knows his shit.

Another issue I‚Äôve had is that two vinyls that I‚Äôve boughten from Amazon sound weird. And it‚Äôs only these two. Whenever I play them they sound a bit slow and the artists voice sounds a bit more deeper. Now it is weird to me that it‚Äôs only happening to the vinyls I bought off of Amazon but for all I know it could be normal or because of another thing. I looked it up and people said it could be my players belt that‚Äôs the issue but I keep thinking that if the player is the issue than why isn‚Äôt it happening with the rest of my vinyls.

I ordered a KAB EV-1 RCM after reading all those comments about records being dirty and about how vacuum cleaning a record can supposedly improve a VG  record to VG+ and such, but to be honest I didn't actually notice any improvement.

What puzzles me about one of these LPs (Paul Desmond's Glad to be Unhappy) is that the wax actually sounds quiet, as in, the quiet parts of the song sound silent, but when a vocal or instrument comes in, it sounds super ""scratchy."" Hopefully that description makes sense. There isn't really that much crackling, but it's still unlistenable. 

Is that a sign of the grooves being worn? Is it really just dirt that I have to keep scrubbing away?

[Most of these records are reissues as I was buying CDs for the most part during the 90s.  Ironically, the worst sounding record of the lot \(De La Soul Is Dead\) IS an original, which I bought brand new when it came out \(for like twelve bucks\).  As vinyl was an extremely niche thing in the early '90s, production quality wasn't really a top priority so they squeezed just over thirty minutes per side, and that's even after eliminating a few tracks from the CD + cassette version\).  The only other original is Flood by They Might Be Giants.  Mellon Collie is the unofficial repress on blue vinyl in the tri-fold cover that includes the bonus tracks on the final side.  It actually sounds pretty damn good for a pirate pressing.  Best sounding LP of the lot is probably the Slint record, which is dead silent, which helps when cranking the silent passages.

vinyl,"For reference I have been trying to save a Verve pressing of ""Night Train"" by Oscar Peterson. I grabbed it in the thrift for $2.99 a while back and have basically tried everything except the ""toothpick"" method. Ice Cube method seemed to do a little bit of help and a couple good cleanings have also done some good but the clicks remain. I'd say about 2-3 tracks are pretty ""annoying"" to listen to but a good 5-6 are pretty tight. 

I guess my question is would any of you guys even bother keeping an album in this shape? Am i doing more harm to my system than good listening to it? I have some other records in this sort of shape from thrifting but I'm getting to the point where I'm not sure it's even worth keeping them. Thoughts? Keep if for art? Send it back to the thrift?

Background: I launched a [podcast about music making](https://anchor.fm/thetuneshedpodcast) with my friend who is a pro. Next Sunday our episode on sampling vinyl comes out, and he suggested taking old records and just scratching them, changing speeds and all sorts of other shenanigans to get weird and fun sounds out. We made a really cool beat on air! But also, would real vinyl heads shun us? If not, do you just buy a cheap set up to do this kind of action?

I find that making records is quite possibly the biggest shit show I've ever been a part of. It's fun. I enjoy it, maybe even love it. Many of my coworkers do not. It's a lonely gig sometimes at the places I've worked at. The company I work for now is brand new and very dysfunctional but it is nice to be able to have all this extra experience that no one else has .

vinyl,"I've been a digital fan of music for years, and have strongly argues this for year. I've owned the ""new"" Rega Planar 3 with Ortofon 2M Bronze for 3 years. Listened for a while, and thought ""what a huge waste of money"". Until I got a proper vinyl setup. Why do vinyl enthusiasts insist that it's better, even with something like a Planar 3? I see daily posts with people having a 15K system, and saying "" I cant believe how good this sounds"" with a 1K vinyl front end. It took me buying a Rega Planar 8 to even compete. It's so annoying to me that people have drank the koolaid that in 99 percent of cases, as long as its wax, it's better. 

Just wanted to point out the BS that comes with Vinyl. If you're doing it for a hobby, great on you. If someone is fitting an ortofon 2M blue and saying its better than digital. I will gladly laugh at you, cause that simply not true. Believe all you want. If you want mediocre bass response, and less detail, I guess it's ""better"".

Point is that vinyl CAN sound better than digital. But unless you spend at least 3-4K plus, it cant compete. Not even close.

note: I also upgraded the 2M Bronze with a 2M black LVB250. Arguably the best MM cart on the market. This was fitted on a Planar 6, until I returned it. Still couldn't compare to digital until I bought the P8. I now own the P10 and its end game for me.",Vinyl is only better when you spend 3K plus.,1649338240,tyd5fl

Unfortunately, before I could stop him, one of the band members signed across the entire last song on one side with a sharpie. I presume it is now completely ruined? Will it be unplayable and clog up the stylus? Is there any way I can play it through a few times with a stylus that I can afford to discard later or will that screw up the grooves regardless?
There are also a few small dots on the vinyl when they started to sign but I stopped them. Can they we carefully removed with rubbing alcohol?

Pre-order means stock will be available if you order now, and when its not well close the pre-order. That is not what it means anymore or at least to Amazon. I don't have to tell you why this sucks- they hold you in purgatory keeping you from buying elsewhere. It is also adding to the artificial demand and after market mark up- at a time when there seems to be some supply. Also if Amazon can do it everyone will do it. Ill admit I shouldn't be buying records on amazon in the first place and will not be going forward- but it doesn't keep this from being wrong. 

Its easy to file a BBB complaint and if they get enough they might stop this bullshiz. Time to rise up! The name of the company is actually Amazon.com Services LLC (not amazon.co)

vinyl,"Hello everyone,  


I've recently bought my first house and I finally want to set up my dream listening room. Coming from the world of headphones, the cost of speakers seems just ludicrous to me ( I have a DCA Stealth &amp; A90/d90 combo and I though I was a big spender) and the diminishing return seems to hit WAY later on the stereo side.   


I've always loved the thought of vinyl but I'm having a hard time justifying the cost considering the fact that even a +100k system I've listened to was noticeably better than a 60k system I listened to. Considering the fact that I'm not willing to spend anywhere close to 100k, doesn't it make more sense to spend the amount of money I want to spend on vinyl and a good record player and cartridges and whatnot and invest it in a better sounding system?   


I'm not sure if this line of thought is prevalent here as well. So I want to know how much did you spend on your system? does it bother you that you're missing out on the better sound quality or does the charm and characteristics of vinyl win you over compared to chasing the ""better"" sound quality.

* Queen - A Night at the Opera - My favorite Queen album, came across the VMP version at a shop.
* Queen - News of the World
* Queen - Jazz
* David Bowie - Space Oddity - With this and Station to Station I now have all of my favorite Bowie albums.
* David Bowie - Station to Station
* Animal Collective - Sung Tongs - Didn't know this was reissued last year, haven't played it yet but I hope it sounds good, one of my favorite Animal Collective albums.
* Cocteau Twins - Victorialand - Recently got into Cocteau Twins, this seems to be a 1986 pressing.  Ordered the Heaven or Las Vegas reissue recently as well, now only lacking 3 of their studio albums.  The shop also had pretty much all of their EPs but they were like $40 each.
* King Crimson - Islands - Only need 3 more to complete their studio discography.
* Mars Volta - Landscape Tantrums - Also waiting on De-Loused and Frances to come in the mail, haven't spun this yet but liked it listening on their bandcamp.
* Pink Floyd - Momentary Lapse of Reason",Recent Local Shop Finds,1649106824,twd9a8

vinyl,"Gotta tell you about what happened just a few minutes ago.

Stopped by my LRS to pick up this Miles Davis release I wanted (The Essential Miles Davis).  It's 2 LP's and is a nice span of his career.

Took it home and pulled out the first LP and it was not the one I wanted to listen to first so I grabbed the other.  Same label on the second one as the first!  I have heard of the label being printing twice but the tracks are correct.  So I spun a few seconds on each and sure enough, it was the same.  Called the LRS and of course the owner said to swing by and I could just swap it out.

Went by and he had another copy ready for me and said to just open it to make sure it didn't have the same issue.  I pulled out the first LP and it had the correct tracks I was missing.  Pulled out the second and wouldn't you know it, it was the same as the first in this one!

So essentially we just had to merge the two to make them complete.  haha  Strange chance that would ever happened.

Replacing the ones that are originally straight paper is a no-brainer, but some pressings already have some version of sleeves that paper+anti-static lining. Do you replace those with 'premium' inner-sleeves too, or leave those as-is because there's not much additional benefit over the factor sleeves?

Secondly, do you toss the original 'generic' sleeves (assuming they have no art, credits, or lyrics printed on them), or do you always store them alongside the re-sleeved vinyl because that's how the pressing shipped originally, and there's some sort of value associated with keeping the original paper sleeves?

Keith,

How you doing man. I thought I'd wait to write to you when i had a lot to say. Do you think you can make it this summer to the beach. This older kid could take us down and back. Make sure you write back fast, because I gotta know. Tell Barb thanks ahell of alot for writing. Yesterday me and three other guys skipped school and 2 girls. The parents werent home all day. Are you still going with Paula? Everyday we go off school grounds and go downtown, if you get caught you get a 3 day suspension. I havent got a haircut since I left Stewart.

I am interested in finding some of the Studio Ghibli soundtracks and ""Just the Two of Us"" by Bill Withers and Grover Washington Jr (thinking of using that as a first-dance song and the vinyl would be a nice touch!).

So I recently got my first vinyl setup for my 21st birthday but I am having a really weird problem with my vinyl setup. Whenever I play a track that has any bass, each bass note creates a really loud pop noise that doesn't sound good at all (and is much louder than the music). At first, I thought I wasn't cleaning my stylus/records well enough, but after playing Daft Punk --which was unplayable, it was that bad-- I switched over to an Elton John record, there was no issues whatsoever. While playing my Daft Punk record only the parts of the track that had zero bass were clear. This made me realize the popping only happens with the bass notes.  

I have a Fluance RT82 with a Schiit Mani 2 preamp as well as a pair of active Fluance Ai61 speakers. Music sounds flawless on bluetooth and sounds very clear when playing vinyl (given there is no bass in the song). Not sure what's causing this issue.

I've been really enjoying this subreddit for some time now. Great to see so much passion for such a wide range of music in vinyl form. So it's well and truly time that I posted something!

Here's my vinyl listening zone... a quick run down of the bits and pieces:

\&gt; A pair of Technics 1210 Mk7 turntables (one with Nagaoka MP-200 cartridge and the other currently sporting a Grado Prestige Red). Why two and no DJ mixer? Well... I got a good deal on two and aimed to sell one on. That didn't happen :lol: Loving the 1210s having had various Rega and Pro-Ject turntables in the past. Direct drive works for me as does the build quality. Also, I dabble in 78s from time to time so the ease of popping on a headshell with a shellac compatible stylus is a boon.

\&gt; Sonos Connect:Amp fed by a Graham Slee Revelation M phono stage. And, yep there's an RCA switch box ahead of the preamp... highly (!!) controversial but it does the job without any ill effects. Honest guv.

\&gt; B&amp;W 607 S2 Anniversary speakers. Oh yes... they are sharing the same surface as the decks... fortunately without any vibration-induced disasters. Phew.

\&gt; Storage by Habitat (the main unit is vintage 1995) and, more recently, I've added some Music Box Design cubes (highly recommended in a lovely oiled oak finish). Then there are cables by QED, bendy lights by IKEA and LP frames by Art Vinyl.

And, most importantly, there's the music! Approximately 60-70% of my collection consists of records I purchased from 1982-ish through to the switch to CD (aaaaaargh) in the early 1990s. I've been adding more over the last four or five years.

Having been brought up on a diet of the late John Peel's radio shows and watching gigs in venues all across London in the 1980s, there's a big chunk of punk, anarcho, hardcore, post-punk, goth, indie and industrial.

There's a fair smattering of prog. A good pal of mine was an afficionado of the genre so I got to enjoy quite a bit of neo-prog (at venues like the original Marquee club). Psychobilly is also quite well represented... back in the day, the Hammersmith Clarendon was one of my favourite venues so it was impossible to avoid 'Stomping at The Klub Foot'

You'll also find the staples like Dylan, Young, The Doors, Bowie etc... but, hey ho, no sign of The Dark Side...

What's on the wall? From the left:

\&gt; 'Curdled' by Thatcher On Acid... 1987 (anarcho) punk along the lines of The Mob &amp; Blyth Power

\&gt; 'Deaf' by You've Got Foetus On Your Breath... the first (1981) 'Foetus' offering from the prolific and most excellent JG Thirlwell

\&gt; 'Violence Sucks!' by Civlised Society... punk fused with metal... a superb 1987 offering from Batley's finest

vinyl,"I started collecting vinyl when I was 17 (I'm 37) and a lot of my early pickups were lower quality-sounding records. As a 17-year-old, I was still in my ""straight-up collecting phase,"" where I would by G/G+ records just to ""have"" them in my collection. I would also only seek out ""earlier"" pressings, because that's what I thought was the point of getting into vinyl. 

In recent years, I'm still collecting vinyl of courses, but I only seek out records that - to put it simply - sound great! I don't care if it was pressed 50 years ago or five days ago. 

All this being said, what are some albums that, universally speaking, just have always soundes great on the platform. I'm talking like ""Aja""-type level, where people routinely use the record to sell or demonstrate their audio systems.

Thanks in advance, all!",Audio-testing Vinyl??,1648332508,tp5kha

vinyl,"I‚Äôve been collecting for some years now and I‚Äôm finally in a financial position to upgrade some of my equipment. After doing so, I figured I‚Äôd cautiously start wading into the world of ‚Äúaudiophile‚Äù releases. I‚Äôve been looking at some of the Mobile Fidelity One Step Ultradisks and Analogue Productions UHQR stuff. I just pulled the trigger on the AP 45rpm pressing of Pet Sounds (very excited) and I‚Äôm considering the UHQR pre-order of Are You Experienced?. These titles obviously aren‚Äôt cheap but I have the MFSL releases of both Highway 61 Revisited and Blood on the Tracks and they‚Äôre my absolute favorites to spin.

vinyl,"Just wanted to document this for anyone else that runs into the same issue as me.

If you're having issues with your turntable that sounds like it's skipping. First check your AV receiver and see if it has a ""Direct"" mode. This bypasses the receiver's internal sound processing and might fix the issue.

My Yamaha TSR 5830 has this, but I wasn't aware of what it did until recently. My setup was skipping very randomly, but often. I wasted a lot of time, money and sanity trying to figure out the cause... This tiny button fixed the issue.

Hope this helps someone in the future!",PSA: Receiver Direct Mode,1648323857,tp1g4g
