Music,"As I grew up, I learned the name of the mainstream artists because my friends were always playing popular songs (like Ariana Grande, Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, Bad Bunny, Daddy Yankee etc.) For whatever reason, these kinds of pop or reggaeton songs never clicked with me, so I didn't ever bother to install Spotify. In my school, my music lessons were basically a joke, and my parents weren't really fond of music either, so my musical knowledge was really poor.

One year ago, however, I met a friend who was a big fan of Imagine Dragons. He introduced me to their music, and I definitely enjoyed it more than most of the other artists I've listened to before. Then, on my own, I started looking for new bands, and I ended up loving songs from groups such as My Chemical Romance, Linkin Park, Fall out Boy, Panic! At the Disco, Coldplay, Green Day or Arctic Monkeys.

Still, now that I'm barely into music, I would like to experiment more genres and find new types of artists, but I don't know where to start. Should I go back and listen to rock classics like Rolling Stones or The Beatles? What do you recommend to me? I have heard of platforms such as tunedly.com from this sub.

Music,"I lost my son to an overdose four years ago. We shared a love for music, so I often today sense his presence in specific songs and bands. His favorite music genre was what I called, ‚Äúsudden emotion,‚Äù (metalcore) wherein the lead singer laid down a melodic verse and was followed by a secondary singer who sang a verse that resonated from, and this is hard to describe, but from the pits of their soul. Hahaha. I‚Äôve been to hundreds of concerts, heck I‚Äôve even seen Barry Manilow and LOVED it, but metalcore pushed my limits a bit. 

When my son was in high school, I would take him and a buddy of his to concerts. That way he got to listen to the music he loved and I knew he‚Äôd make it home safe. The first concert we went to was Atreyu at the amphitheater in Irvine. I brought some industrial earplugs and a book and sat in the upper level. My son and his buddy went down to the floor level and got an eye opening introduction to the violent beauty of the mosh pit. Needless to say, they had a blast. Meanwhile, about half way through Atreyu‚Äôs set I ditched the earplugs and started listening to the music. Specifically, the song Ex‚Äôs and Oh‚Äôs. The raw power hooked me, and the contrasting vocal styles sealed the deal. I‚Äôve never been able to hear lyrics all that well, instead I‚Äôd get swept up by the melody, so the music fit my ear. Soon after, we were hitting a concert a month. I always gave him and his friend their space, as I didn‚Äôt want to be that weird 50 year old dad in the mosh pit, but I no longer brought a book‚Äîor ear plugs. This went on for a period of around 3 years until drugs took over his life and rendered even his love of music from reaching him.

About a year before my son passed, he was homeless. The choice was his, we‚Äôd always welcomed him at our/his home. The problem was: we welcomed him, but not the drugs. Out of the blue one day I heard a literal ‚Äúvoice in my head‚Äù that told me clearly, ‚Äúgo find your son.‚Äù I immediately got in my pickup and drove several miles to the approximate area I‚Äôd last seen him. I saw what I assumed was a pile of discarded clothes next to the road, which turned out to be him. A true ‚ÄúGod-assisted‚Äù needle in the haystack find. I got him up, threw his stuff in the truck and started for home. We stopped at a Walmart along the way where I bought him a set of new clothes and necessities. I got him home and cleaned him up, but after two or three days, his demons called him back, so he once again ended up out on the street.

Which brings us to yesterday. 

Somewhere on this sub, I saw a recommendation for the song Don‚Äôt Follow by Alice In Chains. Like I said, I don‚Äôt hear lyrics all that well, but the melody and the vocals in that song drew me in instantly. The contrast between Jerry Cantrell‚Äôs haunting voice and the power, and emotion, of Layne Staley‚Äôs verse gripped me. I listened to it on repeat a dozen times, progressively focusing on the lyrics, which I pieced together, but didn‚Äôt fully absorb. I knew Layne Staley‚Äôs story. Honestly, any parent of an addict knows Layne Staley‚Äôs story. Absent the fame and notoriety, my son‚Äôs story is Layne Staley‚Äôs story. Addiction doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about fame, it only seeks a soul.

Around noon yesterday, I went into, of all places, THAT Walmart, which sparked a memory of my son. I did my business and came back to the car. When I turned the key, Jerry Cantrell‚Äôs voice hit my ears and I not only heard what he was saying, but I also FELT it:

Hey, I ain't never coming home.
Hey, I'll just wander my own road.
Hey, hey, I can't meet you here tomorrow, no‚Ä¶
Say goodbye, don't follow.
Misery so hollow.

I‚Äôm instantly snot-bubble, body-rocking, SOBBING. That wasn‚Äôt Jerry Cantrell coming through the speakers, it was MY SON singing to me from the netherworld. I completely lost it in the Walmart parking lot. 

FUCK, I MISS MY SON!

After ten minutes or so of abject misery, I gathered myself and paused to take in what happened. It all comes down to one thing: MUSIC. Somewhere in the mix of strummed guitar strings, air passing across the vocal chords, and 26 letters slung together to form lyrics, there is evidence of a higher presence that can invoke all the emotions known to mortal man. In some way, shape, or form, the concept of God is encompassed in music.

So I‚Äôd like to say THANK YOU to my friends in r/music. Don‚Äôt ever stop, fellow Redditors. You‚Äôre beautiful and this old man worships you for allowing me a moment with my son.

By the way, you owe me a box of fucking Kleenex!

TL; DR: My late son sang to me from the Great Beyond, thanks to the awesome power of music (with an assist by Jerry Cantrell and Alice In Chains.)",The Awesome Power of Music,1651944177,uki0hy

Music,"My apologizes if my vocabulary for this is poor I don't know enough on this concept hopefully I explain this properly.  


Video games have this function where it allows it to piece together portions of a song. It will repeat a section over and over again until you get to a trigger that causes it to play another portion of the song. The chainsaw sound effect portion of songs from Doom (2016) and Doom Eternal are probably the most well known and documented games of this. However I'm looking more for something like Black Mesa's final Gonarch lair fight.   


Where the system played the beginning of the song on a loop until it was given a trigger. At which point it would then look for ""the nearest off ramp"" that lines up with the next portion of the song to be looped. Then it would stop playing the first portion and play the second. When the fight is over it would again look for ""the next ramp"" and then fade out.   


While video games have this function programed in I was wondering if there is an application that does the same thing. Where you can mark up audio files for possible exits and shift from one to the next. 

Thanks in advance for any information.",Live sound mixing like a video game.,1651923101,ukbddt

Doja Cat has released a new tune named ‚ÄòVegas,‚Äô which is taken from Baz Luhrmann‚Äôs upcoming Elvis biopic soundtrack.

Doja‚Äôs new single, which was released on 6th¬†May, reinvents the well-known song, which was first performed by blues musician Big Mama Thornton in 1952 and famously covered by Elvis Presley four years later. The rapper incorporates Thornton‚Äôs vocal samples into her cover, as well as her own blazing bars and a cutting trap rhythm.

This Love (Taylor‚Äôs Version)‚Äô is another track from Taylor Swift‚Äôs rework of the 2014 album ‚Äò1989‚Äô. Taylor Swift took to social media to announce the track‚Äôs arrival on 6th May.

It came with a lyric video that featured a length of boardwalk surrounded by swaying grasses and a dusky blue sky, with the song‚Äôs lyrics fading in and out across it. Look it up below.

 The song was first featured in the trailer for an OTT‚Äôs new show ‚ÄòThe Summer I Turned Pretty‚Äô. Swift confirmed that the re-recorded tune would be released in full later, writing on social media that she has always been incredibly proud of this song.

Music,"Jack Harlow the media personality and Jack Harlow the musician are two completely different entities. When the cameras are rolling, the laidback coolness Harlow has made his only notable musical trait blossoms into an irreverent character that is responsible for coining a number of the decades' fads. So far, that‚Äôs been enough to keep the name Jack Harlow in your head - something his music is yet to do. Despite this, *First Class* was the first song Harlow released where I felt he wasn‚Äôt making music for music's sake. The hit has a sub-three-minute runtime and uses nostalgia via a sample as its salient selling point, making it an ideal specimen in the TikTok climate. 

Harlow certainly isn‚Äôt the first major artist to tailor his music to recent consumer trends, but he‚Äôs among the most careless with the way he goes about it. *Come Home The Kids Miss You*, Harlow‚Äôs sophomore album, is low on energy and originality. When he isn‚Äôt copying Drake (who appears on the album), Harlow is ripping himself off in order to repeat the ludicrous levels of success he‚Äôs garnered. 

If you don‚Äôt have the resilience to sit through a 45-minute Jack Harlow album, everything there is to know about the Louisville rapper can be gleaned from the two singles *Nail Tech* and *First Class*. The former credits eight different people as producers but ends up jacking its swinging brass melody from a song Harlow has already been involved with. Without Lil Nas X to hold his hand, however, Harlow is unremarkable in the *INDUSTRY BABY* sequel. And on *First Class*, he names luxuries that are so commonly brought up that Harlow makes being rich sound like a chore. It is a sour reminder of how he has departed from his light-hearted roots.     

Just three years ago, with *Confetti*, Harlow‚Äôs goal was to put his hometown on the map. That mixtape had purpose, it tried to pay homage to the streets and artists Harlow knew best. *Come Home The Kids Miss You*, on the other hand, is indistinct. Throughout, the production is breezy, guided by midi loops and plain percussion patterns. It‚Äôs the sort of repetitive, greyscale slapdash you‚Äôd expect to hear on an anonymous SoundCloud user‚Äôs self-produced album. Worst of all, any substitute could rap over these beats with the same half-hearted demeanor Harlow affects.  

*Dua Lipa* is the album‚Äôs most frustrating song. Not because it sounds bad, but because Harlow shows supreme technical ability only when the possibility of creating a few headlines and hashtags emerges. On the chorus, light on his feet like a dancer, he goes, *‚ÄúDua Lipa, I'm tryna do more with her than do a feature‚Äù*, vehemently. He coasts for the rest of the song. Other superstars show up, Justin Timberlake, who hasn‚Äôt released solo music since 2018, sounds out of place isolated on the chorus on *Parent Trap* and Lil Wayne mumbles his way through his verse on *Poison*. Neither of these active participants gets energy out of Harlow in the same way his fantasy does.   

The public name-drop is a move straight out of Drake‚Äôs rule book. The two have been pictured together as of late and it‚Äôs clear during their time shared, that more has rubbed onto Harlow than just the Canadian womanizers' sleaze. Not only does he enlist Drake for *Churchill Downs*, but he also mimics the melancholy from his *Take Care* era. The most interesting revelation to come from the five minutes they share is the chronicling of Drake‚Äôs ongoing feud with Pusha T. *Side Piece* is dressed up with all the conventions of a Drake song, too; a beat-switch, a vengeful partner, trouble with personal psychosis, but the *‚Äúgrown-up shit‚Äù* (his words) just doesn‚Äôt suit Harlow.    

His best songs have always perched somewhere between fun and fine. The song closest to recreating the exuberance of *WHATS POPPIN* is the Pharrell-assisted *Movie Star*. Harlow‚Äôs singing voice, somehow meeker than the one he raps with, is smothered by the bleeps and bloops of the bouncy beat, but when the listening experience is genuinely fun, who cares? His connections serve him well on closer *State Fair*, too, where Harlow‚Äôs shallow recreation of his birthplace is sheathed by a soothing flute melody that wouldn‚Äôt sound out of place on *Flower Boy*. But these are anomalies on an album that is otherwise strictly curated to make sure his music remains uniform to keep his trajectory that way.

Hip-hop can be unforgiving with how fast it moves. Before a big-name artist can capitalize on a trend it‚Äôs likely already nearing staleness. The pursuit of the next Jack Harlow never ceases. What‚Äôs keeping this current iteration of Harlow at the top, though, is sheer persistence. He‚Äôs been all over everything since *Thats What They All Say*, which is precisely why *Come Home The Kids Miss You* is so ineffective. Harlow‚Äôs album about being rich comes too soon after his last one. On behalf of all of the kids, we didn‚Äôt miss this.

Music,"**NoKissing, evokes depth and delicacy in his newly-released single, ""GreenEyes &amp; EyeLiner,"" which came to fruition after a string of recent singles releases.**

The single emerges as the latest unraveling of the American singer-songwriter's (from Detroit, MI) soul-searching through his wide range of genre-bending influences from Kurt Cobain to Juice WRLD. Each of his releases are stepping stones on a journey increasingly revealing an introspective expansion of the artist‚Äôs mind and heart.

Shrouded in secrecy, outside NoKissing's melodic outpourings, he discloses nothing more than bite-sized fragments about his music, which serve more as hints rather than clarifications. About the single, NoKissing's few words of self-description are as concise as they are a question mark in and of themselves, that ""this song is ambient, upbeat, with reflective subject matter.""

Taking these questions into the release, together with visually-arousing lyrics, attention-demanding voice, enticing bridges, a catchy hook within smooth production, the listener encounters a floating motion, melancholy blended with beauty, reflecting the confrontation between the mind‚Äôs paradoxes and the emotional release that the music provides both artist and listener.

""GreenEyes &amp; EyeLiner"" comes as a major artistic milestone for NoKissing, after his recent single release, ""Leave Me Alone,"" and the music videos for his captivating singles, ‚ÄúBADTHING‚Äù featuring MVRV, and ""GreenDay,"" the latter of which has racked up over 51K views on YouTube to this day.

Music,"
Self taught, spent five years finding my style transitioning from to another with a total of 3 before I settled with the one I have now which I‚Äôm quite satisfied with and feels like ‚Äúme‚Äù the most.

Granted there are some specific artists that have influenced me a bit but I think that‚Äôs to be expected of a self taught singer who loves listening to a lot of music.

And it seems that people are divided about this. Some say to find your own voice and don‚Äôt try to imitate others at all and some say the opposite, I personally think that doing both is the best way to do it.

I did try to imitate them back then in terms of how they did certain things like belting and such, I eventually went a few steps back and use them as stepping stones in order to discover how to do those things in the context of my own voice.

They brought up certain names that I don‚Äôt even sound like and I find it odd that the ones that influenced me don‚Äôt get brought up.

Should I let that concern me?",Is it bad if some people point out that I sound like I‚Äôm trying too hard to sound like famous singers when I‚Äôm actually not doing that?,1651874918,ujyntt

For example, when I hear the first major hits of Adele ""Someone Like You"" and ""Rolling In The Deep"" or perhaps Lady Gaga's ""Bad Romance"" or ""Poker Face"", or Psy's ""Gangnam Style"" it feels like the songs are still new, like they were released yesterday - like no time passed between then and now.

But at the same time when I look at my own life, events that happened when these songs were released feels like ancient history... like so long ago... like a lot of time has passed.

Music,"Quote, Poem or lyric for a memorial of a musician

Hello everyone, I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to put this in, however I'm not sure where else. 

My father was a musician who passed away of a heart attack back in January and due to COVID restrictions here in Canada we pushed a funeral off and instead are doing a celebration of life this month. I have been struggling to find a good quote or poem or something for the back of the memorial cards for the event.

I'm looking for something music related because music was his life. He was nominated for a Juno back in the 70s (Canadian Grammys for those unfamiliar) and I was hoping someone here might be like minded and aware of something suitable for such an event.

Of course if this is too broad of a sub please point me to one that might be better. Cheers and thank you so much for any consideration.

Hello people of reddit,

I have an assignment i need to do for college in which I need to research how to promote concerts for  
a relatively unknown creator. I got assigned to research Ghostpoet a.k.a Obaro Ejimiwe. He is from the UK and makes alternative rock music since 2009. Part of this assignment was interviewing people in the target audience.

It would really help me if you could answer the questions below. I would really appreciate the help. If you don't like posting your answers publicly for whatever reason you can always dm me. You can skip any question if you are uncomfortable with answering it. These questions are purely meant for research for my assignment and I will not do anything with the answers except use them as data in my assignment.

Here are my questions:

**Survey questions**

1. How old are you?
2. As what gender do you identify?
3. In what area of the world do you live?
4. to what artists do you listen most often?
5. Do you know any of the following artists or bands?

* Mount Kimbie
* Wild Beasts
* Baxter Dury
* SUUNS
* Young Fathers
* Burial
* Gonjasufi
* Roots Manuva

**Interview questions**

1. Did you already know you know who ghostpoet is before the interview? If so; Do/ did you actively listen to his music?
2. how do you think alternative rock can be best described?
3. Which artist introduced you to this genre? Why Was their music so compelling to you?
4. Who is your favorite artist and why?
5. How important are lyrics for you when you listen to music?
6. If you go to concerts what is your primary reason to go?(The music itself, The artist, the atmosphere)
7. Would you go to concerts more often if there would be pre-events
8. What would your ideal alternative-rock concert be?
9. Do you have a favorite album cover? If so, Which one?

Thank you in advance for answering my questions. I really appreciate it.

And I didn't know that it was already found out long ago. And for the Upholsterers, they are rough but still like their music.

And this reminds me of a Pink Floyd's Division bell, where they said that if you answer the riddle, you will get a reward. It is not solved this day, and many said that it was a hoax.

And another little note: Jack White version of Jolene sounds slightly similar to the 33 rpm slowed down version. I have a hunch that he already knew the slowed down version because he's a huge fan of vinyl experimentation.

Now this time, which foreign songs or non-English songs are in your opinion, the ‚Äúworst offenders‚Äù? Also doing this to broaden my music tastes.

I‚Äôll start with a KPop song from a group called Aespa. The song is called *Next Level* and though the label that manages them (SM Entertainment), is known for experimenting a lot in their songs. I just can‚Äôt comprehend why they chose to do a mash up of a beat driven pop track with some kind of jazz then back to that pop track. The cohesion is lacking imo

And another KPop song from a group called Miss A. The song is called *Only You* and if you listen closely, you can hear some sort of yelling or screaming in the background that doesn‚Äôt add anything to the song.

&amp;nbsp;

As much as I downplay it in person, there‚Äôs no denying it: I can sing. Like, really well. But I can‚Äôt seem to do it in front of people, or whenever I think about how someone might hear me. I‚Äôve been trying to break myself out of this shell by singing short snippets of a song with others in the car or, when there‚Äôs no accompanying music, singing longer bits quietly and trying to increase my volume. I don‚Äôt know if any of that is working.

&amp;nbsp;

My mom has been living with me for a few months, and I can‚Äôt do vocals like I used to when she‚Äôs here. I didn‚Äôt think twice before, but now if she‚Äôs even in the house I‚Äôm so self conscious about it.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I love to imagine myself on a stage behind a piano belting out one of my songs‚Äînot always thinking big, just in packed a bar or coffee shop even‚Äîbut I know if I can‚Äôt get across this bizarre psychological canyon I‚Äôll never be able to experience that.

&amp;nbsp;

I‚Äôm nearing a point in my life where it‚Äôs now or never if I want my music to be heard, felt, and have the biggest impact on the most people (I might be wrong about this, but its been gnawing on me for a few months).

Music,"Title says it all, really.  I‚Äôm a big fan of Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Metallica, Guns N‚Äô Roses, Nirvana, Alice In Chains‚Ä¶ stuff like that.  But those bands either no longer exist, or put out their best material decades ago.

The only bands that became popular this century that I really liked are System Of A Down, The White Stripes, The Black Keys, and Ghost.  But the first two are gone, and the third is wildly inconsistent.  Ghost is awesome, though.  Overall, though, I‚Äôm stuck in a musical rut.

Fortuitously, I was browsing a certain NSFW subreddit focusing on full-frontal nude pictures of celebrities, and happened upon one or two featuring singer Halsey.  I wondered what that was about, and discovered they were from a feature-length film released to promote her latest album.  An album that was produced and co-written by ‚Ä¶Trent Reznor?  I‚Äôm intrigued.

I knew ‚ÄúBad At Love,‚Äù and wasn‚Äôt much of a fan.  Seemed fairly generic to me.  But the thing that I really didn‚Äôt like were the vocals, which reminded me of Ellie Goulding, and that awful song from the Fifty Shades of Grey films.  So, I had low expectations.

My expectations were met, mainly because I couldn‚Äôt get past the vocal style.  Except for the third track, ‚ÄúEasier Than Lying,‚Äù which has a very loud, shouted, uptempo chorus that really grabbed me on the first listen.  But one song does not a good album make.

I added the song to my library and listened to it a few more times.  I started to notice new things on each listen.  A brutal industrial-flavored screech in the first chorus.  The instrumental swell at the end that could have been lifted from a song on NIN‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Fragile.‚Äù  Could this catchy pop song have more layers than I thought?

I decide to give the album another listen.  I start to get past my instinctive dislike of the vocals.  I notice more things I like.  I find myself singing along to a chorus or two.  I find myself turning the volume up more.  Some of these riffs really do grab you.  I turn the volume up more.  I start belting out that I am not a woman, I‚Äôm a god, as I let the song‚Äôs building synth riffs wash over me.  I add the entire album to my library.

I timidly told a friend about it, who has similar tastes to me but is pretty open-minded.  He said it was the best NIN album he‚Äôd heard in 20 years.  A little facetious, as it‚Äôs clearly not a NIN album, but he did like it.  I now find myself listening to it every day, often more than once.

There are probably only about 15 albums released this century that I‚Äôve enjoyed pretty much all the way through and considered to be among my favorites.  But, this might be #16.  I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôve enjoyed a *pop* album this much in‚Ä¶ forever, not that I listen to many pop albums in their entirety.  But, no matter how much it may differ from what I usually like, a great album is a great album, and I‚Äôm glad to have found something that expands my musical horizons a bit.","I‚Äôm a 40 year old man who mainly listens to 70s-90s hard rock, metal and grunge.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a Music Producer from Myanmar and I became a refugee after the military coup started.

I lost my career, job, home and everything. So after a year of trying to get a place to sleep and work, I started making music again.

I am very appreciative and grateful even if only one or two people like my songs. 

Your small shed of light is great support for me.

&amp;#x200B;

So....these are my new release songs :

Music,"The next Millennial Whoop?

I've been hearing this clich√© a lot lately, and I'm wondering if it is common enough where it merits a name.  The musical clich√© is what I'd call a ""playground 'yeah!',"" usually on the 4 just prior to a new verse.  

Recent example: [Galantis x Roxette's ""Fading Like a Flower"" at the 1:20 mark](https://youtu.be/Mk4C9ynvXaI?t=78) and multiple other times throughout the song.

Catchy as hell, but officially starting to grate on me.

Have we collectively noticed this enough where it deserves a name?

What should we call this trope?",Do we have a name yet for this musical trope?,1651798068,ujbjhb
Music,"So, at the beginning of the pandemic (when there wasn't much to do) I decided to embark upon a music journey. Rather than listening to the same things on repeat, I wanted to expand my knowledge of music and listening behavior.

For this 'challenge', I went to the Rolling Stone magazine and pulled up the list of their Top 500 albums: 
https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/arcade-fire-%ef%bb%bffuneral-1062733/

Now, I don't think it's really possible to truly ""rank"" music because it is so so subjective, but with their updated list covering a broader range of music styles, I figured it would be a good list to listen to. For the record, I don't think their list is what I would necessarily choose, but I'm happy to have found some great new music nonetheless.

I started at 1 (Marvin Gaye's, ""What's Going On"") and have officially reached 250 (Buzzcocks ""Singles Going Steady"").

Now, that I'm halfway, I want some album recommendations from you all!

I realize that these rankings leave out wonderful albums and aren't always diverse enough in their lists, so I want to take a break from this list and hear some new stuff that you think is good!

Here is a Google Sheet, so you can easily see the albums in order* (I made this list as I was going along for fun and left a comment for each album - the comments don't always indicate the overall felling of the album, some are just fun facts I learned): 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vzYPdHE1u1DwyZN9UWyNLNmajqj83OwsD9LXGEAhdKk/edit?usp=sharing

Music,"1. The RARHOF exists to make money, not to be objective or well-informed in their ways. It is, for lack of a better term, a tourist trap.
2. Only six or seven acts out of the thousands of genuinely quality rock acts are inducted every year; some will *have* to be left out. That's how numbers work. Not everyone can have their way.
3. Some inductees are assholes or ""problematic"", so inducting them would cause the RARHOF's reputation to take a hit, thus they pander by inducting people like Eminem.
4. Almost all inductees are nominated by previous inductees, meaning they don't often align with what the public want. The hall is basically a circlejerk for that reason. You probably shouldn't be so worried about who's in, it's basically meaningless.

So hoping to get more suggestions from all of you!

**Backstory:** I grew up listening to the radio and could only afford to buy a few CD's. Eventually I was listening/making mixed CD's and downloading songs on Limewire. Then eventually Spotify came. Basically my whole life I have never really listened to full albums, just singles.

A few years ago, I bought a record player and it has completely changed how I listen to music. I also realized I love so many albums from the 60's, 70's and 80's. I am now making a list of all the albums I never listened to and giving them a try!

I started making my own list, but found that almost all of my entries were on the Rolling Stones list.

Music,"I‚Äôve recently come to realise just how stacked the song title ‚ÄúCalifornia‚Äù is\*. Obviously there‚Äôs the phantom planet classic, and its many covers, perhaps most notably by Lisa Mitchell. But then Lana Del Ray, Lorde, Grimes, CHVCHES, James Blunt, YUNGBLUD and Childish Gambino have all made songs of the name, many of which are pretty enjoyable, and others which are the Childish Gambino version.

Sons of the East have a version, as does Polish Rapper White 2115 with 55million Spotify plays. 88rising, Ricky Montgomery, the Lagoons, Oliver Tree, girlfriend. This list really does go on and on, I‚Äôve barely scratched the surface. And this absolutely isn‚Äôt mentioning the plethora of songs containing ‚ÄúCalifornia‚Äù, because then we really would be here all day.

So my question. Is there any other exact song title with quite so many completely different, high quality songs as ‚ÄúCalifornia‚Äù?

Even accounting for the fact that a lot of these are B-side songs, I just can‚Äôt think of another title that contains so many versions by top artists. By my count ‚ÄúCalifornia‚Äù has at least one smash hit, at least a couple famous versions, and at least 6/7 big songs, on top of plenty more depth beyond that.

Also, what‚Äôs your favourite ‚ÄúCalifornia‚Äù?

Music,"I have this habit of sometimes revisiting music trends that I was not alive to be a part of and/or went under my radar for some reason and trying to expand my musical spectrum. For some reason, I recently obsessed over 2000's Rock/Punk and have been listening to a lot of it. Honestly, there's a lot of garbage in that genre. Of course, there's also a lot of good/great stuff. Nothing, however, stuck with me as much as MCR's ""The Black Parade"" album. I listened to it a least 100 times by now and, yes, I consider it a masterpiece that should be up there in the highest echelons of Rock music. 

Being the nerd that I am, I researched everything I could about the Album, its musical references, and MCR's status at the time, and I landed on this conclusion: TBP will never reach its potential as a classic because of their incredibly obnoxious and, frankly, very weird fanbase that didn't allow people (especially older people at the time) to see the project as anything other than another Emo album. I understand the importance and ideas behind the emo movement but there's an enormous gap between that and glamorizing suicide, self-harm, and depression. Of course, there are people that just really enjoy the music and consider themselves fans, but a good portion of the MCR cult is not composed of this type. 

Of course, I'm not saying MCR is not popular. TBP is their most commercially successful album and songs like ""Teenagers"" are well known by everyday people. My argument concerns legacy (a central point of the Album's musical and lyrical themes, btw) and how this project will probably never have the status it deserves among music enthusiasts.

I'm sure that this has happened before and after with other artists (Nirvana?). Stan culture is a part of the internet musical landscape and has definitely harmed the mass appeal of some good projects. I'm also conscious that MCR's dedicated fanbase also hugely helped their careers and there's a chance I might have never heard one of their songs if not for their support.",My Chemical Romance's musical legacy was harmed by their own fanbase.,1651766164,uj0kjl

Music,"This question is more specifically for music groups during that time especially boy bands like Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC.

I was listening to some stuff from the 70s to 90s and I‚Äôve observed the difference of how harmony layers and backing vocals were processed during those times.

Songs from the Jackson 5 and Michael Jackson‚Äôs solo stuff had harmonies that sound way looser and you can hear how many takes of the same harmony they recorded (e.g double tracked harmonies to be panned symmetrically on the stereo field).

Then we had Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC but unlike the former two, the processing from the vocal layers sound so tight that you won‚Äôt even notice that there‚Äôs two takes of the same line and instead, feels like one voice.

I read that in order to do this, timing accuracy is needed which I believe can be done pre digital processing (?) and then we had pitch accuracy where autotune for pitch correction comes in.

Are they just really good at singing the same line as identical as possible with only microtonal differences? Did they record multiple takes until they got 2 that could work? Was there autotune involved and something like Vocalign?",Is it safe to assume that most singers after the birth of autotune in 1997 have some level of pitch correction on their vocals?,1651763741,uizp3u

Music,"
Self taught, spent five years finding my style transitioning from to another with a total of 3 before I settled with the one I have now which I‚Äôm quite satisfied with and feels like ‚Äúme‚Äù the most.

Granted there are some specific artists that have influenced me a bit but I think that‚Äôs to be expected of a self taught singer who loves listening to a lot of music. 

And it seems that people are divided about this. Some say to find your own voice and don‚Äôt try to imitate others at all and some say the opposite, I personally think that doing both is the best way to do it.

 I did try to imitate them back then in terms of how they did certain things like belting and such, I eventually went a few steps back and use them as stepping stones in order to discover how to do those things in the context of my own voice.

They brought up certain names that I don‚Äôt even sound like and I find it odd that the ones that influenced me don‚Äôt get brought up.

Music,"Cicada is the name of an insect that makes a very familiar summer sound. I used this sound in the first version of the track as percussion but I eventually removed it as it was taking too much space. Every track that I make starts with an intention that is quite different from the outcome and sometimes even the founding elements are replaced. In this case, the cicada sound inspired me in the entire process but was no longer needed when the track could live by itself.

Ninon Corpet is a friend of mine. She‚Äôs not a professional singer but I thought that her voice would fit well with the universe of this track. Ninon‚Äôs high pitched voice matches with the fairy-like atmosphere that I wanted to achieve for Cicada.

This is the only Phaune track with a voice. I spontaneously write only instrumental music. I like voices but I‚Äôm not very comfortable using them and I don't write lyrics. But this time, it just felt like the thing to do. Also this track has a certain pop feeling I think. It is therefore drifting a bit away from my universe.

I wanted to create a ‚Äúfunky forest‚Äù feeling. I like when music feels inhabited with living forms. This is where my alias comes from. Electronic music is a great way to create fantasy worlds that you can populate with funny creatures. Though the sounds refer mostly to vegetal stuff, some of them sound like animals to me.

- They play a massive mix of genres in their albums (rock, rap, funk, soul, classical, jazz, metal, electronic music), and have mix of these and other genres in their albums, and even in one song.

- I can't remember, but either a song, an album or even their band name has the word ""Elephant"" in it somewhere.¬† Possibly with a colour (blue, orange, pink I think?) as the adjective (*Orange Elephant*/*Blue Elephant* etc)

- Their songs are kinda long (4-9 minutes)?

- They have a fair few members I think?

- They're at least 15 years old (heard their songs in 2006-7-8)

- They have instruments like the sitar etc in *some* of their songs.¬†

However, I would love to work there. I went there for the first time physically last year as a bit of fun since my work was paying me to work half an hour away, and I fell in love. 

Problem is, I live about 3 hours away, and since it's not cool for companies to tell how much potential future employees would make, I have no clue if they'd come anywhere near the amount I'd need just to move down there. My other issue is I'm unsure how good they expect an employee to be. To be honest, I'm more of a producer than I am a traditional musician, but they're currently hiring someone to create content based on DJ/production gear, which I would adore! But I don't know if the example they'd expect would be something with 50 layers or a simple tune with 10.

Music,"So I was on my laptop earlier listening to the radio while playing a game on my laptop, a song came on and I left the game to check the title, it was Knights And Heroes by Crystallion.   
I thought it was pretty good and listened to it via my desktop speakers after I stopped playing as they are higher fidelity and are much louder, it sounded OK and not as good as I expected. 

The singer was clearer but the clarity highlighted that she wasn't exactly amazing. On the whole I was unimpressed. I have experienced this before with artists sounding better or worse on better equipment but not to this degree, probably because my laptop speakers are just a bit shit.   


So if you have only listened to artists via your phone, small earphones, a laptop and haven't got anything better I suggest having a look at something better, you don't even have to break the bank, my desktop speakers were ¬£5 used, I don't use them for serious music listening as I have my hi-fi for that but they are good enough to highlight the details of a song.   


What i'm trying to say i0s that it's all about clarity, my hi-fi is like looking at a piece of art with my current glasses on, my laptop is like looking at the art with my glasses off and my desktop speakers/my bathroom speaker (which is of equal quality and made by the same manufacturer) is like wearing my old glasses - I can see but it's not exactly 20/20 vision.",Speakers matter.,1651709686,uikiyz

Music,"This music video is from year 2013-2016.
 
Visually - It‚Äôs two women in a big house and the song is about one woman trying to leave and the other wanting her to stay. It is choreographed ballet style dancing throughout. Like one lady is heading towards the door and the other pulls her back in dance style. The house was pretty big if I remember correct.

Audio - I know it was a female singer. I want to say the genre was country. The songs theme was about a break up or someone trying to leave and wanting them to stay.

Music,"Hi guys!

I was doing some research on Music Discover, and I found that people's main complaint is that it takes too long to find new music you love or it takes a long time to sift through all of the boring music before finding a gem.

This was the core insight that led me to start developing a new way to shorten music.

If you'd like I can email over a sample playlist (just provide your favorite genre+2 songs) using the shortening algorithm to test out.

Sign up for the waitlist below if you are interested and I'd love any comments/criticisms :)

Music,"Attention @everyone !!! I put forth a challenge that will make you take a look at yourself!    I want everyone (who wants too) to make a TOP 20 SONGS OF ALL TIME playlist. This can be anything, no judgement. It can be sentimental or just a badass jam. Please TAKE YOUR TIME. Try to rank from 1 to 20 (best to well 20th best). I don't want to see or hear anyone say they have a list in the first 2 weeks. I want this to take at least a month of your time to let the music sit, stew, make changes, revisions. Memory is a fickle thing. If anyone has questions, comments, or ideas please feel free to tag me and I will take a look. I know we all have similar taste but honestly our genres range widely.    So the end goal is to get everyone together and listen to everyone go through their list (not fully). snippets here and there, explanation of certain songs on the list, etc. And have a good time hanging out. So please, enjoy this, take your time, visit some old tracks, some deep cuts. I think this will be interesting.    HAPPY LISTENING!!!

Music,"Yesterday's ""Civil War"" post reminded me of this recent discussion with friends.

Guns N Roses *Use Your Illusion* albums have been a part of my life since they were released. I love them. But what songs would have made a kickass single album following Appetite and Lies? Friends and I all had some overlap, but some good differences.

Opening it up to other artists and albums: 

**Make the best single disc album (under 74 minutes) you can from a multi-disc project.**

Here's my *Use Your Illusion*. I intentionally left off anything where Duff or Izzy took on vocals as part of my own rules for it even though that meant leaving off some of my favorites.

1. Dead Horse	(4:17)
2. Back Off Bitch	(5:03)
3. Shotgun Blues	(3:23)
4. Yesterdays	(3:17)
5. Right Next Door to Hell	 (3:02)
6. You Could Be Mine	(5:44)
7. Don't Damn Me	(5:18)
8. Locomotive	(8:43)
9. Estranged	(9:24)
10. Perfect Crime	(2:23)
11. Pretty Tied Up	(4:48)
12. Coma	(10:16)
13. Breakdown	(7:05)

It's phenomenal and anyone who is a casual Stones fan or someone who likes live rock albums I'd say it's a must listen. 

The interplay of guitar between Keith Richards and Mick Taylor is incredible, Mick Jagger absolutely delivers along with Bill (Bass) and Charlie (Drums) sound as tight as ever. It also sounds really clear which is a miracle considering other live recordings around the time. 

I cannot recommend this album enough. If not for the music itself, it's also a great timepiece of what this historic band sounded like at the height of their career.","Appreciation for The Brussels Affair, A Live Masterpiece",1651611005,uhpn8t

Music,"Google‚Äôs English dictionary provided by Oxford Languages defines art as ‚Äúthe expression or application of human creative skill and imagination‚Äù

Without getting into an argument about whether or not pop music is good (because I can‚Äôt be bothered to argue with one million Justin Bieber fans), I can instead make a statement which cannot be argued with. Modern Pop music that you hear on the radio is driven by consumerism. What I mean by this is that thee objective is to make as much music as possible with as little money as possible. I can think of many examples but perhaps the most important one is that music theory has been dumbed down to a formula which any musician (or non-musician) could follow to make a catchy song.

By doing this, chord progressions in modern pop music are NOT an example of ‚Äúthe expression or application of human creative skill and imagination.‚Äù This also applies to rhythm where you can hear the same drums in many different songs, and many other elements.

Since creativity is defined as ‚Äúthe use of imagination or original ideas to create something; inventiveness.‚Äù And art is an application of creativity, and pop music is built around purposefully restricting creative freedom.

Almost all my recent verses I haven‚Äôt thrown away either which has NEVER happened. It‚Äôs rare I keep a verse. Yesterday when I was at the store with my mom my stomach felt butterflies and I felt like I NEEDED to write to get a weight off my chest and I went home and made my best verse ever

Here lately I‚Äôve been caught in other life stuff and other things have been occupying my mind. But here lately the only thing that‚Äôs been on my mind is writing verses and anytime I have free time I‚Äôve been writing. I‚Äôve always been motivated but this is insane!",I think my motivation for music has elevated to another level!!!,1651595491,uhk05t

Music,"Hi all, I looked through the rules and I don't think this is violating, but I understand if this question is not ""directly"" related to music.

Basically, I have never found listening to music to be fulfilling on its own. Sitting down and listening to an album, or putting music on to do chores or while I'm driving around has never been that enjoyable, and I am consistently... disappointed in myself? for not ""appreciating"" the art form in the way that most of my peers and just people in general seem to do.

I always use music very mechanically, and functionally. I basically only find myself listening to two types of music, very hype and energetic hip hop like Run The Jewels or Denzel Curry, or softer more melancholic indie rock like Peach Pit or Beach Bunny. Writing is my favorite hobby/pastime, so if I'm writing something with a heavy dose of one of those two moods I will put that kind of music on. Not out of enjoyment but just to put my head into that kind of framework. I also use soundtracks a lot from this, namely Animal Crossing: New Horizon if I'm writing something more light and fun, or Mr. Robot if I'm writing something intense and moody.

I'll get into a loop with particular songs that make me feel a certain type of way, right now that's Black Sheep off the Scott Pilgrim soundtrack, but I can never sustain interest in a style or artist to continually listen to music for pleasure, just when I need or want to feel a particular emotion, and when that song is burned out I generally stop listening to music regularly until a different song hooks me and the pattern repeats.

This has never been a huge problem for me. Recently though, I feel like I've been missing out. If I have the opportunity to put on music for coworkers, or if I am extremely bored and don't have anything else to watch or listen to. And I should mention that I'm no stranger to musicality or music theory either. I played piano from elementary to high school, and picked up guitar and bass on the way too. And I will use those instruments to play those one-off songs, for me, until I reach the boredom point.

I'm not looking to ""fix"" this, I don't think it's a problem. I just would love to know how music fans react to this, and if you have any advice to try and get more enjoyment out of the art form. Right now I feel like it's a very practical relationship, but I know there is more fulfillment/enjoyment to be had.",Do I Enjoy Music In A Weird Way?,1651592045,uhir13

Music,"I really like the music ... it introduces you to the funeral setting and then the exposition lets you know that it's the speaker's funeral. Figuratively. 

The line, ""I didn't have it in myself to go with grace"" hits me so hard. I always interpreted in the way of wanting to walk out of a relationship without causing a scene. Quietly. Assuring the other person that 'its okay... we'll be fine. Just give it some' - when in reality, after a point you just want to punch the ceiling or yell on the call! Make them regret the way they treated you unintentionally. You know you can handle this like a mature person but you don't want to! Cause you can't! You need it to be over for you to start healing. But in that process, you ruin it beyond anybody's capability to recover it.


But now that I heard it again.... I interpreted it in a different way. How nice it would have been for the speaker to gracefully exit the relationship, with no sour feelings? Instead she died on her way out. 

Ending of a relationship is always difficult. It's like, a part of you dies along with it. And it sucks so much, when the person who killed you with their bare hands gets to yell, ""NO!!! WHAT HAPPENED?""

""WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?"" 

How can you be that oblivious? Could this be an act for the people around or for your own ""clean"" heart? Regardless, you can take off your angelic mask. 

For some reason, people just like pretending. They pretend to care while you're struggling, when they are the main reason behind it. And that's what this line symbolises, ""and you're the hero, flying around ... saving face"".


But my 2nd fav line has to be, ""&amp; I can go anywhere I want, anywhere I want... just not home"". 

It's so simple yet... magical. Maybe break-up was necessary. Sometimes things don't work out for whatever reason and you need to walk out before it can create you more damage... &amp; you are free to go anywhere. 

But then, with you I felt the most at home with. And now, I am homeless. Ahhhh. This song has been on repeat for past few days. It just hits me in feels.",my tears ricochet: Taylor Swift,1651569571,uhc4hz

Firstly, I‚Äôd just like to hear some of you guys‚Äô recommendations for songs that I could listen to, to broaden my knowledge of how people have tried to fight back against dictatorships and war. 
I know some anti-war songs criticize wars, while others promote peace. And yet more satirize the whole thing.
And secondly, I was thinking of Pink Floyd‚Äôs recent release, ‚ÄúHey Hey, Rise Up‚Äù to support Ukraine. And wondering how much of a difference these songs actually make?
Cheers in advance folks!","War pigs, by Black Sabbath, is an anti-war song with more power, now that we are witnesses to Putin‚Äôs destruction, than it did when it was released in 1970, IMHO.

So, I know there's been an ""underground"" scene with music at least since the inception of Rock music. I'm curious about the lyrical content. In mainstream music in the 1900s, 1910s, 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, etc, the lyrics seemed pretty buttoned up and proper, no swearing and such.

I'm curious about bands/singers during these times that used profanity in their music. Are there any resources I could explore to find these kinds of bands? Profanity has always existed, right? So it stands to reason that profanity would exist in lyrics too.",Question About Older Underground Scenes,1651564482,uhb0zu

Music,"So I like the typical lyrical rappers (NF, Eminem, token. Newer hopsin, some logic, and vin jay). I‚Äôve grown to have better taste because a lot of lyrical rap I see as cringe. The lyrical rapper vs mumble rapper song by vin jay I don‚Äôt like because it‚Äôs generic, overdone, and cringe. And a lot of times newer Eminem sounds good but the lyrics are solely for rhyme scene and for that sometimes I can‚Äôt help but laugh because I can‚Äôt take it serious

I like lyrical rap cause I love how the change flows so much, and it‚Äôs just so pleasing to my ears and other rap doesn‚Äôt really do that for me the way lyrical rap does. I think I have a good understanding of what makes rap good because I make sure to say something in my lyrics. Even if my song doesn‚Äôt have a set theme I‚Äôll let a stream of thoughts happen and I‚Äôll go to one topic to the next but I never just rhyme to rhyme. I never go fast and just say random words ether, when I go fast my rhyme scheme is pretty basic but I stay on topic when I do so. And I never talk about being the ‚Äúgoat‚Äù or ‚Äúsavior of rap‚Äù but I present myself with confidence and say things in a more unique way. With all of this I think I have a good understanding of rap but I‚Äôm still scared to release stuff because of the rep lyrical rap gets, what do I do? Just release and say screw it? I don‚Äôt want to change my style to please others but I also don‚Äôt wanna be deemed a cornball before I even get a chance",I wanna make lyrical rap but it gets a bad rep so I‚Äôm anxious to release stuff,1651561012,uha9x4

Music,"Tuesday's and Friday's I typically host album listening nights. We take suggestions from listeners and explore all time periods, and genres. As this is meant to be a live event, there is an intro song inserted before the first album to ensure that all participants are synced up before the first album begins. There is also an intermission song inserted between the albums for anyone to take a break if required. We typically do 2 albums each night, but sometimes we sneak in a third. The point of the nights is not just to listen to great albums, but to hopefully find something new that shows you that there is great music in all genres.

I'm not sure whether to go with CDs or vynels. I think vynels look better, but don't display very well on a shelf. While CDs display... better but still not that great. And I'm not sure what the sound quality is like for each case.

I can't think of a single classic song that's been covered, where the cover is better than the original. I get you want to honor the song and show your appreciation but I think for the most part, no one wants to hear it unless you're whole deal is BEING a cover band. That's different. But artists with original work, who throw in a singular cover on their album.... yuk. 

I'm getting tired of my Spotify Discover Weekly being polluted with mediocre covers of great songs. I've actually submitted a request to Spotify to be able to filter covers and remixes haha. 

Anyway, every time I hear one, I think ""why???"" Usually if I explore the artist they have great originals but of course it's their shitty cover that's made it into my Discover Weekly.

Music,"So, for context. I've read American Gods, and in it was a part about a man that was described as a dwarf (they never actually said he was a dwarf, just that he had the physical characteristics of one). He started humming in the car, a deep sound that reverberated through the windows, a sound that you could feel through the whole car.

Ever since I read that, I've been having this daydream of me sitting around a campfire with people, or auditioning for a play, or what have you, and singing like that. Starting out as a deep hum, maybe a few words even in between. One of those songs that when you close your eyes, it tells a story that you can see in your mind. You can close your eyes, see every detail of what the song is describing. One of those songs that when you open your eyes it feels like hours has passed, like you were literally in another world.

I know this is an unusual request, but I'm looking for songs like that. Ideally it would be only vocal. Words also aren't really required. I was thinking something like dwarf mining songs, but the results I found are too close to sea shanties. Think Misty Mountain Cold, except only vocals, deeper and maybe not even in English.

I hope I'm explaining this right. If I'm not, feel free to ask more in the comments.",Songs that transport you to another world,1651526276,ugzz7f

Music,"I really loved the new book on Roger Daltrey - ""Roger Daltrey and the Bright Shiny Object"". Read it twice. It shed some light on the music industry that is totally unknown to most people. I had no idea of what it takes to make an album. All the hours and anguish. All the work. All the ‚Äúaha‚Äù moments. The journey to get there. The dedication to music. It‚Äôs a unique and interesting perspective on Roger Daltrey that dives into his world, his personality, and his home and family. Broken fly rod. Grape fast. Tea. Stinky dog breath. Foxy Lady‚Ä¶ It shows the successes, struggles and disappointments of the author to climb what seems, at times, to be an insurmountable mountain. I have a whole new appreciation of the recording industry, from the wonder of seeing the Beatles recording studio at Abby Road, to the twists and turns that can make or break, to the cutthroat reality that seems to be all too common.

Music,"For months now I have been trying to log in to my IOS Ticketmaster mobile app to access my tickets for this weekend. Today I finally scoured the globe and was able to get past that pesky login screen. Here is how I did it:

IOS:
1) Reset your password on a computer. If you‚Äôre password is older than February then it will prompt you to do it anyways, just do it on a laptop to simplify the app log in as much as possible.
2) Turn off any VPN or Adblock service you have installed. If the cookies are being blocked, you will be stuck at the login screen eternally.
3)Head to Settings -&gt; Safari and make sure Safari is your default browser. 
4)Scroll down to extensions and make sure your VPN is off.
5) If not already, Turn off Block All Cookies 
6) THE KEY PART. Go to Advanced -&gt; Website Data and click clear all. This will reset your saved cookie preferences which can be a touch annoying, but not as annoying as missing your concert from not being able to log in. 
7) Kill the Ticketmaster app and reopen. You should now be able to log in as normal.

Once you add your tickets to your Apple wallet then you are free to (and definitely should) add your privacy settings back and switch your default browser again.

I was wondering will the violin be a hard instrument and will it be hard to learn, and if it will, will my piano-playing and knowledge of music help learning the violin and slowly master it over time? 

Both violin and piano are my favorite instruments and I can't wait to try out the violin! If anyone could give me some insight, that would be greatly appreciated!

Music,"hi it would be greatly appreciated if anyone could comment or provide their own insight and opinions on this topic for my research assignment. 

this is my general question. i have so far been researching into: 

impacts of the surge of female hip hop artists in the 90s 

inclusivity of the riot grrrl movement

pop music such as the spice girls 
influence 

and more modern day such as recent popular artists predominantly like megan thee stallion, cardi b and pop artists like ariana grande and taylor swift. the way they preform, present themselves, their music, their messages and music videos. 

keep in mind that i am researching into the intersectional aspect of WOC
musicians as well, and how they have been persecuted in the industry. 

i would very much appreciate if anyone can talk about their opinions or information on particular artists influence, any discussion about objectification vs liberation etc.

I think the video also shows a little boy so maybe the rap is about him growing up or maybe it's about his son. The rapper's name might be jj something or something jj but I highly doubt it.

Music,"I‚Äôm (30 M) living in Scotland and I‚Äôve heard these guys via my YouTube Algorithm over the past 2 years. I‚Äôve only recently started broadening my search with them and I‚Äôm really digging their sound. 

I see they‚Äôve been out for at least 15 years, or that‚Äôs when they had their debut self-titled album (2007). 

They obviously are popular if they‚Äôve been going for so long - and their music videos look like they have money put behind them, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had any conversations about them, or have anyone recommend them to me‚Ä¶. 

So what gives? Have I missed them? We‚Äôre they more popular 10 years ago?

They‚Äôre still producing music which is still really good to my ears, they‚Äôre sound has changed with time rather than stagnate. 

I like them enough to go through all their discography which is what I‚Äôm going to start doing now.

Music,"This is rant post about my music. I‚Äôm SO passionate about making music and all I wanna do is make good rap songs and it feels impossible

I started making verses at 15 and I‚Äôm 18 now. I‚Äôve improved and my flow, lyrics, and rhyme schemes have gotten better but it feels like I‚Äôm still just a wannabe that wont ever be ‚Äúready‚Äù to release stuff

What‚Äôs frustrating is token was my age when he made songs like ‚Äúcode red‚Äù and that song would be IMPOSSIBLE for me to make right now. Code red constantly flows hard with witty lyrics (sometimes corny, but that doesn‚Äôt matter). I seriously don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm missing. I‚Äôve never had my voice professionally mixed but I don‚Äôt wanna go to a studio if it‚Äôs just gonna turn out to be garbage 

I‚Äôve improved so much and I‚Äôm proud of that, but it feels like I won‚Äôt ever be at a point where I‚Äôm comfortable releasing music. I don‚Äôt wanna pay for recordings if I don‚Äôt stand out or have anything to separate myself from the crowd. I plan on making rock rap stuff after I get normal hiphop down but my voice fucking sucks too

I slur my words so much and my voice won‚Äôt portray the right tones and energy. I‚Äôve recorded voice memos of my verses with my phone speakers and the mic is awful in it but you can get a general vibe of the song by doing that. I‚Äôve posted it to reddit a few times and some people say they‚Äôd totally put it in their playlists while others say it‚Äôs cringe and hard to listen to. I know criticism is something I shouldn‚Äôt take to hard and normally I don‚Äôt. But when do I have to accept its not good? And is it really not good or is it because the mix is messed up?

It feels like if I release stuff now no one would choose to listen to me when there‚Äôs PLENTY of better artists to listen to. Granted, I can improve, but why not just wait to release stuff then and save my money not going to studios?

And on top of all that I don‚Äôt wanna wait to release stuff when I‚Äôm 21+ cause then I‚Äôll be busy with other life stuff. I feel like if I don‚Äôt start now I‚Äôll never start and then abandon my passion for music. I‚Äôve wanted to make music for so long and while I‚Äôm better, the fact I still doubt myself and never release it gets to Me. I‚Äôll never feel happy until I take this passion and ACTUALLY make something more than words on paper. Every fucking day I listen to rap verses and picture im the one spitting those and I feel my excitement grow so much. When will I actually get to do that? 

All in all I don‚Äôt know if I should trust the ones saying I‚Äôm good and to record, or if I should listen to the ones saying I still have a long way to go before I even think about recording. I‚Äôll admit, a lot of my verses suck. But every once and awhile I get songs that (imo) are good, and those songs are becoming more common. But then I post rough shitty memos and get 50% of people clowning me and 50% praising me. Idk what to do but I‚Äôm about to say fuck this and give it up. This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve been close to giving up but it takes such a tole when I wanna pursue my passions but can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm only 18 and I can‚Äôt see any value being in what I make now. I‚Äôm no token or Eminem when they were my age so what‚Äôs the point in fooling myself?",I don‚Äôt know if I can ever actually be a rapper,1651470573,ugiqpm

Music,"Aside from potentially getting flack for my musical taste...what do these two songs have in common?  I can't put my finger on it but there's something about both of them that evokes a certain imagery for me - art deco, orchestra, lounge jazz...  I know that's a really random and disparate group of descriptions, but I can't do any better.

I like the rhythmic pace in both of them, the driving bass, the sort of melancholy tones.  Speaking of them separately, I love the light tapping of the cymbal in ""Boyfriend"" along with the strong bass lines and the sort of crooning she does - for some reason it makes me think of an old lounge with a woman singing on stage.  In ""What Goes Around,"" it's the Turkish stringed instrument in the intro and through out, the rhythm and bass, the violin (?)...  It evokes a certain grand art deco image...but that may be because of the music video tapping in from my subconscious.

These two songs may have absolutely nothing that binds them, but they both make me ""feel"" the same sensation so I feel like there must be something there that I just don't have the knowledge or vocabulary to identify or communicate.

Any chance anyone can help, or can recommend other songs in the same vein?  They both set a vibe I love and I want more of it so I can make a playlist, but I can't figure out what to search since I don't know what common thread they share.","What do ""Boyfriend"" (Dove Cameron) and ""What Goes Around"" (Timberlake) have in common?",1651455896,uger01

I'm 30 when I was growing up there were legit hits, made u feel good, everyone loved them, rock rap pop would come out with these great songs. A universally appreciate legit banger every week. Someone put on a 1999 playlist at work the other day we all enjoyed about 40 hit songs in a row and we knew and loved all of them. And I brought up how music sucks now, we put on a hits of this year and last year. No one knew a fucking song and the ones we did know we were like its ok. But they are not legit hits. Like blinding lights was like the most streamed song of 2021 or something, that is not a good song, it's an ok song. That wouldn't even be considered a hit when I was growing up. Covid did hit but it's not proportional , that's not an excuse for how much pop music sucks rn. And my bigger question is why is no one talking about this. Seriously is someone getting laid more or something by not discussing how music objectively sucks right now. What is the reason. Music sucks. It really does. We don't get hit songs anymore.

I have been making music for about 6 years now and one of my favorite things about it has always been being able to connect with people around the world through music, especially through live performances. And although all my friends have grown up around me and are doing different things in life they still come out to support me when I play live shows. Honestly, that keeps my spirits up when things get tough since I know how much it means to them.

I don't have long so will have to make this brief.

So I've recently just gotten out of a pretty dark period. Addiction and stuff. Next to no Internet access, so my taste in music is a little dated. I've been talking to a girl; I'm 99% sure it's platonic (happy to make non addict friends! ü§ì), but she's recommended some music and I want to reciprocate with some music we'd both like! 

The problem is the music she's recommended is pretty modern and upbeat whereas my music is a little older and more emotional. The Last song I recommended was Kurt Vile's Pretty Pimpin'. She texted a big list that was a mixed bag of Pop-punk, Ska and kind of semi-generic rock.

People are just like sheep, they follow each other, copy each other‚Äôs behavior, copy music styles. There is too much thinking ‚Äòinside the box‚Äô in music, almost everybody is copying each other. And one of the  the worst thing of all is: The few people who decide which music and new genres becomes popular are also thinking ‚Äòinside the box‚Äô. They decide what becomes popular and this must change. Ofcourse luckily there are lot of streaming services with independent artists who promoted themselves. 

Q1: how do you see the ideal music distribution in the music industry?

2:
Royalties.
Musicians who make, for example: music for television series, music for YouTube videos and streaming services, music for Radio earn money from Royalties. (Not only from royalties).

Because now there are a lot of big streaming services like YouTube, Spotify, Netflix where the music of these artists is heard. 

My issue: 
Nowadays full time musicians who make this music have to work their @SS off to earn money for decent living.
Seriously, when in the past (when streaming services where not so much compared to nowadays) a full time musician would get decent money from decent working hours; nowadays it‚Äôs like working overtime without getting decent financial reward. I know the past is the past and now is the present and that comparing past with present events is not the solution.

These kind of artists are really underrated and deserve way more than they do now.
We cannot enjoy screentime without these artists. Watching a movie on Netflix without music is for some movies as boring as rollercoaster disconnected from power.

Music,"Tl;dr
6/4 is Pink Floyd.  6/8 is Queen

So I asked my stepson this pedantic question.  He has a lot more ‚Äòformal‚Äô music training than I do, but we practice and jam together for fun.

He sighed and insisted it was just tempo.  I argued.  It was only for fun philosophical discussion, but he got a bit passionate and annoyed.  Then he went on the attack by poising Pink Floyd for me forever:

He pulls up YouTube and says:

This is 6:4 time:  https://youtu.be/54W8kktFE_o?t=486

Then he changes the playback speed to 2x and declares, ‚ÄúThis is 6:8‚Äù.   Laughter ensues.

After hearing the vocal part of _Shine On_ I realize, this is exactly what it would sound like if Queen wrote and performed _Shine On_.

Give it a listen.  It‚Äôs hilarious.

Follow the link, click the gear icon on YouTube and set the playback speed double.   Pink Floyd magically becomes Queen.   It‚Äôs still an epic London sound, just a more high-strung drummer.",Difference between 6/4 and 6/8 time (funny),1651404482,ufxws7

So I am in my village's local fanfare. I got my dad into game music such as Assassins Creed, Halo etc. He is now in the music commision of the fanfare and is asking me to track down some good game music to play with the fanfare.

The problem is that I mostly find stuff for harmony, but not fanfare. I also may be searching in a wrong way.

I am wondering if anyone here has any expierence in finding sheet music from games for a fanfare assembly. Either a specific composer or perhaps a sheet music seller. It must be an assembly with a directory for the condutor to follow and such.",Need leads for fanfare game music.,1651400572,ufwzkg

Music,"hey guys.

i've been making music for some time now and started to release my music last year. (i'm making mostly indie pop and ambient music) in 6 months, i'm planning to have a series of concerts and i'm not sure about my stage name.

before I started even releasing music, I thought using my name and surname as an artist name would be interesting, (I'm Turkish btw) because It's an unusual name in general, nobody has that name and surname in the whole world (I'm one of the lucky ones I guess) and I thought It could even sound ""ethnic"" or ""interesting"" to people around the world.

i've been wondering, how to come up with a stage name that will match with my personality. i'm searching something that will match my vibe more.

is it something you say ""yes! that's it! this is my stage name!"" or you never feel sure about it for real?

what do you think about Nil Abƒ±≈üka as a stage name?

After I had a 40 min rave I was feeling so happy and not emotional about the conflict at all and I couldn't stop thinking to myself how much music can just change your entire mood in the current moment, The music reaches your soul and uplifts it (at least for me anyways) I don't really know if this is a weird post or not but I just felt as if I needed to share my thoughts somewhere, I'm not looking for sympathy or anything but I just wanted to share how music turned such a shit moment into a great time where I could laugh and smile :)",Music can make a shit day a great day.,1651393137,ufvbyj

I recently remembered finding this tape among my dad's collection and listening to it a whole bunch of times. I knew all the lyrics before I spoke a word of English. I'm not quite sure what genre this fits in, but this one, State of Independence and The Mayflower really worked my imagination. Also you can really hear the Bladerunner soundtrack in this music since it was written around the same time.

Music,"Hi, I‚Äôm Jasper and I‚Äôm very proud to share with you all my EP Dreaming of Reality that I have been working on for the last few years!

&amp;#x200B;

‚û°Ô∏è [https://jasper.fanlink.to/Dreaming\_of\_Reality](https://jasper.fanlink.to/Dreaming_of_Reality)

&amp;#x200B;

*Dreaming of Reality* is a 5 track EP that brings together pitched and processed vocals, punchy drums, ambiant and textural sounds, giving it a dark alternative and experimental feel to it. 

As the title suggests, this EP gravitates around the strange relationship and conflict between *Dreaming* and *Reality*. Throughout this project, Jasper brings us into his deepest obsessions, most intimate and terrifying thoughts about these two concepts and the pervasive anxiety from having been stuck between the two.

&amp;#x200B;

This project is, both explicitly and implicitly, deals with my inner struggle with *Depersonalization/Derealization* (DPDR) - a poorly diagnosed mental disorder that‚Äôs hard to understand, accept and describe - and the way I have perceived myself and reality through it, for many years.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As a totally independent artist, amongst so many, with not much of a network, I‚Äôm trying my best to get this project *out there* so that people can listen to it and so that I van get some feedback on something that has been in my head for so long !

&amp;#x200B;

I got so many comments telling me to just go and do it. I hesitated for a few days after making the post, and then I bought myself a single ticket so I had to commit to going. 

I was so nervous all day leading up to it, excitement but nerves, I couldn‚Äôt stop going to the bathroom and I was sweating all day. I got there and I was surprisingly nervous but comfortable. Got myself a nice piece of merch, a nice Coca-Cola. 

It was amazing. I recommend it to anyone, especially if you have bad anxiety. Getting out of your comfort zone is the last thing you want to do when you have anxiety, but sometimes it‚Äôs just what you need. I didn‚Äôt feel pressure to dance. I didn‚Äôt feel weird for not dancing. I surprised myself by cheering and clapping.  The people around me were really nice. It was great :‚Äô)

Music,"I'm writing a research paper on the depiction of the working-class experience and working-class attitudes in the lyrics of Rock/Metal songs. The plan is to create a timeline from the 70s till now, starting with John Lennon's Working Class Hero. 

I've been able to find plenty of material about corruption, poverty, warmongering and the like, but I've found it difficult to find songs specifically about the working class. Some strong contenders for contemporary (2000 and onwards) are Nine Inch Nails' Everyday Is Exactly The Same and Rise Against's Re-education (Through Labour). 

I'd especially appreciate recommendations for songs from 1980-2000, but any recommendation from the last 50 years would be greatly appreciated :)

Frontwards my wolves
Amidst the bright star's light
Call for Jehoschua
When the wolf shatters your soul

Jehoschua is a Hebrew form of Jesus.  I get the anti-Christian slant, but it‚Äôs kind of unusual to use the Hebrew variant of the name Jesus given that Jews don‚Äôt believe Jesus is anything but a regular person.

Music,"Hi all, I just have a couple quick questions about recording some drums and a keyboard I have. Hopefully someone has some info I could use!

Q1. So im on a budget, and not incredibly tech savy when it comes to music recording unless its for guitar! I have a drum kit I wanna record, however, I cant afford having a mic for every drum. I have seen some people do 1 mic setups. So my questions is, how can I effectively record my drums with 1 mic, should I use dynamic or condeser, and will my Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 that I use for guitar work the same?

Q2. So I found this really old keyboard in my wardrobe and I remember I had it from when I was a kid. I've started leaening it and want to record it, only issue is idk if itll plug into my PC and work on my DAW (Ableton Live). Its a Casio CTK-230 and its really old (at least 15 years). It only has 2 ports on it, one that says DV 9V or something for plugging it into the wall with an adapter i assume, and the other port says phones/output. Will the phones/output port still work if i plug it into my PC somehow or will i need to plug it into a speaker and record the speaker instead? (Or just get a new keyboard entirely)?

Thanks, any help is appreciated!",QUESTION: Recording Drums and Keyboard!,1651325620,ufb6nd

""We are a group of Jazz streamers and enthusiasts devoted to the promotion of the online Jazz scene. We originated as a coordinated effort to organize a celebration event on Twitch to commemorate International Jazz Day on April 30th 2022. Soon our initial goals quickly grew as more people joined the team and brought fresh ideas and talent.  Our main goals are two:  - To coordinate a celebration of International Jazz Day online every year.  - To promote  the Jazz streamers scene and help musicians get more visibility.  We hope to become a meeting point between Jazz musicians and enthusiasts, to help streamers promote their art and create new bonds and synergies between communities and streamers through the organization of events during the year and showcasing online jazz around the world.  We are a group of volunteers doing this for the love of Jazz. Currently we are running under our own funding and we are not affiliated with any party or business. Our purpose is not to take benefit from the streamers in any way, because of this we will never ask streamers for money or become Twitch affiliates, and any credit and publicity we get for organizing the event will only be used to help promote new ones and thus help streamers get even better results.  Everyone is welcome to become part of our community, but you are not expected to do so in order to be featured in our events. It will always be something optional, we want you to join only because you believe in the same things we do. We would like to conclude by giving our thanks to all those streamers that have already put their trust in us and are participating or supporting this effort.""","Hello, there is currently going on Fist Jazz Festival 2022!",1651319486,uf9i9l

It‚Äôs about a character lost in nature in a world where he survives on his own, reminiscing about a lost loved one. He ventures around parts of the world seeing different things which will be animated and eventually reaches a small home and is welcomed to stay there

Music,"On the cover of their third studio album, *blue water road*, Kehlani revels in the sunlight of a beach setting, their hair is down, they are free. It‚Äôs a far cry from the position they assumed on the cover of 2020‚Äôs *It Was Good Until It Wasn‚Äôt*, barely peering over a wall. It was fitting for an album that chronicled a period of Kehlani‚Äôs life where nothing but darkness was guaranteed. In the two years separating the albums, Kehlani has done some soul-searching, explored parenthood, and come to terms with their identity. Problem is, only marginal growth is reflected in the music of *blue water road*. Kehlani has plenty to say nowadays, but there‚Äôs not much separating how they and a hundred other sensual r&amp;b crooners are saying it.  

Despite the overwhelming similarities *blue water road* shares with previous Kehlani albums, it is singular in the fact that it follows a perfect loop. The first and last thing we hear is the gentle frothing of waves, a symbol of peace Kehlani returns to throughout the album. It is a reflection of Kehlani‚Äôs status during their musical absence. A towering orchestral segment on *little story* brings Kehlani back to reality, though, disrupting their window of rest and recollection. But the album‚Äôs other twelve songs never reach the same heights, nor do they come close to making such a bold juxtaposition. On their own, the monochromatic sounds register minimal emotion on Kehlani‚Äôs part. Anchored by a leitmotif on top of that, everything starts to sound the same. 

Hitmaker Pop Wansel is partly to blame for the album‚Äôs languid complexion. He‚Äôs credited as a producer on every song. It‚Äôs clear his best ideas have been exhausted by the demands of bigger stars. Kehlani is guided by the metallic twang of a midi snare that twitches on *altar*, and for *melt*, their creamy voice teeters on an acoustic guitar melody that oscillates between just two notes. Without a discernable pattern, these songs loop aimlessly, undoing a formidable pop format the in-demand producer has used religiously to raise his stock. It seems out of character for Wansel, who is well acquainted with this seductive brand of music having contributed to many of Miguel‚Äôs most airtight sleazer anthems. 

On the bright side, with no real competition, Kehlani‚Äôs ruminations of the dangers and pleasures of commitment overflow. The peril is at its fullest on *get me started* where potential adultery complicates Kehlani and Syd‚Äôs relationship, *‚Äúmaybe she can do it better (Better)/I guess, choose peace over stress (Oh)... If you wanna leave, be my guest‚Äù*. It sounds like an argument so personal we were never meant to hear it. Despite the obvious risk, there is catharsis to be found in choosing the right lover. On *everything*, Kehlani‚Äôs anxieties are outweighed by carnal desires, *‚ÄúI know you was made for me, think you was made with me/Shit feel like destiny‚Äù*. The attraction is naked, brought to life only by Kehlani‚Äôs excited rambling. Nothing more is needed. 

This sort of troubled romance has been the interest of Kehlani for years now, but with *blue water road*, they find ways to crystallize their emotions and up the stakes. *‚ÄúCan I borrow some money? Can you call me an Uber?/My mama needs surgery and my son needs a scooter‚Äù*, Kehlani sings with palpable distress in the brief chorus of *shooter interlude*. In the best possible way, it‚Äôs ugly. The song offers an unglazed glimpse into the consequences of Kehlani‚Äôs poor love life, an aspect they‚Äôve brushed aside in favour of shallower evocations in the past. 

Elsewhere, the idea of a revamp is overlooked. In tune with the ardent spirit Kehlani sports due to recent personal milestones, the aura of the album is ostensibly bright, but their voice carries all the deadpan attitude over from *It Was Good Until It Wasn‚Äôt*. On *more than i should*, Kehlani investigates the moral complications of cheating on an inadequate partner. They neither justify their fantasy with lyrical results nor salacious tension. A telling measure of Kehlani‚Äôs anonymity is the accuracy with which they match Justin Bieber's level of blandness on the duet *up at night*. Their voices are just too closely related to have the impact of separate performers. And if Bieber‚Äôs feature wasn‚Äôt enough, *tangerine* channels all of the failed suggestive code of *Yummy* through an awkward food metaphor of its own. 

For all the talk of growth that has surrounded the album‚Äôs release, the results should be more notable. No longer is Kehlani bogged down by the tragedy that permeated their last album. *Blue water road* is the antithesis, light and breezy, but so rarely does Kehlani seize the moment to make the music livelier. The rigorous editing Kehlani employs to keep the music spotless and stripped of battle scars makes it almost exclusively for casual listening. They could‚Äôve been singing these songs eight years ago and will very likely be singing slight variations eight years from now, too.

Music,"I like to use best albums lists when I get listener's block and freeze at the thought of having the whole history of recorded music at my fingertips and no idea what to listen to.

What makes a good ""best albums"" list? There are a lot of samey ones out there, but there are also a lot of trollish ones - a good ""best albums"" list has a solid POV and makes sure to pay respects to the obvious classics while also having some well-argued surprises. In the age of SEO media has struggled with sticking to a certain perspective that might alienate a potential audience, and lists have not been immune to reflecting those shifts. But some lists still get the job done.

Here are a few of my favorites:

[KEXP's top 666 albums](https://www.kexp.org/countdowns/kexp-listeners-top-666-top-albums-all-time/): This is a really good list put together by a public radio station that plays a lot of alternative and indie-leaning rock, though the list is not confined to those genres. Has a lot of albums that are more populist and don't always score high on more critical lists, bands like Silversun Pickups or Nada Surf, for example.

[1000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die](https://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/steveparker/tommoon.htm): A book by Tom Moon that attempts to narrow down the entire history of music and its recorded output to 1000 essential recordings across all genres. The ballsiness to even try is charming, and well, he does pretty well considering how tall of an order it is. The classical recordings are very good across the board, and it's hard to argue with many of the choices, but:

\- there is too much jazz and anglo pop and rock; while I agree that a list of this nature should have plenty of both it goes far beyond even that

\- there is too little music from a lot of places around the world - just to cite Latin music as an example, there are some huge gaps, like not even a single cumbia recording, which is unforgivable

\- there's a sort of museumish quality to the list at times - maybe inevitable when dealing with so much music outside of one's expertise, but occasionally going through these albums feels like a chore

The Rolling Stone Magazine list of top 500 albums: there are two versions of the list. The first, [made in the early 2000s](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-156826/), was a great sort of summary of the ""rockist"" album canon that privileged mostly white guitar-based rock as the best and most authentic music. It's a solid list considering those limitations. They [updated the list recently](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/), and while it is interesting, it is also kind of a mess. To cite the Latin music references again, the selections included are random and wouldn't give a curious fan a real sense of where to begin with Latin music - it feels very much like the poll of a group of different critics and musicians it was, and maybe could have used a stronger editorial hand to figure out what the post-rockist canon should look like. As it is it is a bit too anarchic and all over the place for my tastes.

[The Virgin All Time Album Top 1000 List](https://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/virgin_1000_v3.htm) \- Another pretty rockist list by Britsh author Colin Larkin from the turn of the millennium. Has a bit more of the bands like Pulp or the Stone Roses that were more popular in the UK than the US. Also goes much deeper on classic rock than even the original Rolling Stone list, bands like Rush and Def Leppard do much better on this list.

[Pitchfork decade lists](https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/) \- Pitchfork has done best albums lists for each decade from the 1960s to the 2010s, and they are a good mix of rock, pop, hip-hop, R&amp;B, electronic music and a few other genres, though they have pretty big blind spots when it comes to some other genres like country or blues. I wish Pitchfork would attempt its own ""best 500 albums of all time that define the Pitchfork aesthetic"" and also try to go further back than the 60s, because I think music from earlier eras still gets a bad rap across the board as being too dated or lame to generate much interest.

Those are my favorites off the top of my head. What are your favorite ""best albums"" lists? What makes a good ""best albums"" list?","What's the best ""best albums of all time"" list?",1651277974,uezbub

Music,"I didn't really listen to music when I was young. Until I traveled to a new country and someone introduced me to the Queen, I listened to it for almost a year then got into the Beatles, the Righteous Brothers, Johnny Cash, and Bob Dylan. Another year passed, I then began listening to classic retro wave style music such as Kavinsky. Shortly after that, I got extremely obsessed and became almost an avid fan of Daft Punk. I listened to it for almost two years before getting a bit more into a more modern one like The Weeknd and Tame Impala, but the reason I listened to both of them was simple, a lot of their songs had an old school retro vibe. That‚Äôs roughly the time I found the fact that every time I listen to pop music, any pop, hip hop, k pop, I feel like I‚Äôm going to get epilepsy. Within 3 months later I went back to the 70‚Äôs psychedelic rock music: Pink Floyd. 

I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm the only one who‚Äôs like this, I really don‚Äôt enjoy modern pop and I rather listen to something old and classic. Not sure if I‚Äôm the only one here.

Prisonnier de ton propre corps. Sauveur qui a √©chou√© sa mission. Tu cries de tout tes forces mais personne de t‚Äôentends. √âcroulement √©motionnelle, t‚Äôas famille te renvois chez toi. La peur d‚Äô√™tre oubli√© t‚Äôencombre chaque nuit Mais quand tout √áa va-t-il s‚Äôarr√™ter? Tu ne peux y √©chapper. L‚Äô√©norme chat t‚Äôemp√™che de te lever de ton lit. La chaleur du f√©lin de transport dans un sommeille digne d‚Äôun conte de f√©e. Tu lui supplie de te r√©veiller. R√âVEILLE! 

J‚Äôai vue ses oiseaux l‚Äôautre jour. Ils volaient vers leurs destins. Rien de les emp√™che de voler de leurs propres ailes. Vole oiseaux vole. Enfui toi de ce monde maudit. Nais pour mourir, vie pour passer le temps. Vole comme ces oiseaux de la libert√©.¬†  

¬†A quoi sert -il de rester des ann√©es √† l‚Äô√©cole? Si on peut mourir le lendemain. Je veux √™tre libre comme ses oiseux dans le ciel.

 Prisoner of your own body. Savior who failed his mission. You scream with all your might but no one hears you. Emotional collapse, you have family sending you home. The fear of being forgotten weighs you down every night But when will it all stop? You cannot escape it. The huge cat prevents you from getting up from your bed. The warmth of the transport feline in a slumber worthy of a fairy tale. You beg him to wake you up. WAKE UP!  I saw his birds the other day. They were flying towards their destinies. Nothing prevents them from flying on their own. Fly birds fly. Run away from this cursed world. Born to die, live to pass the time. Fly like those birds of freedom.   What's the point of staying in school for years? If we can die the next day. I want to be free like his birds in the sky.

But the record belongs to Rod Stewart who once performed in front of 3.5 million people in Copacabana beach on his free new year's eve show.

&gt;She explained that her initial reaction to the nomination was based on a misconception about the institution. ‚ÄúIt was always my belief that the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame was for people in rock music,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI have found out lately it‚Äôs not necessarily that. But if they can‚Äôt go there to be recognized, where can they go? And so I felt like I was taking away from someone that maybe deserved it certainly more than me since I never considered myself a rock artist. But obviously, there‚Äôs more to it than that.‚Äù",Dolly Parton Changes Her Mind on Rock Hall Nomination: ‚ÄòI‚Äôll Accept Gracefully‚Äô,1651243191,uendx5

Hi guys, just wanted to know what is everyone‚Äôs favorite debut album of the 2000‚Äôs. Personally, mu pick is Interpol‚Äôs Turn On The Bright Lights.

Given the time it came out and sonically speaking, this album just sounded so fresh and unique, even in 2022. And the later ‚Äúremastered‚Äù version with a cleaner production just cemented this album for me as one of the greatest debut albums I‚Äôve ever heard.

I know that the competition is stiff and I just wanted to know what is your guy‚Äôs personal picks for best debut album of the 2000‚Äôs.


Some honorable mentions could be:
- Get Rich or Die Trying;
- Is this It;
- De-Loused in the Comatorium;

 Amongst others.

Music,"Hello,

As most of my friends and family using spotify, we noticed Spotify tends to cage us in a bubble when we use the radio tool.
Indeed, up to 50% of the radio's listed titles are already in our ""Liked"" playlist, the rest are always very close to what I already listen to, making it hard to discover new bands and styles 

This week I decided to tidy up my ""Like"" playlist and move the titles to well ordered playlists, as I was doing so, I was removing the ""Heart"" from every titles.

After I was done, I tried to use the radio again, It blew my mind how different it became suddenly, I never discovered as much new bands and music in my Spotify user life.

TLDR : To have a better radio experience, remove all your titles in your ""Liked playlist"", the Algorythm doesn't pro-actively try to include songs you already know or close to those.",[PSA] : tip a better Spotify Radio,1651222271,uehkxm

Examples could be darker New Wave and much of the Goth scene. As far as the 60s, 70s and decades after the 90s, it seems to me that there isn't as much to find. What there is, is all much further toward the margins. Only thing I can think of very recently off the top of my head is maybe Ghost and some of The Weeknd's work. I love synth/darkwave stuff like Perturbator and Carpenter Brut but those guys are sadly not anywhere close to the greater cultural consciousness.

Music,"Hello, I don‚Äôt know if anyone here is an expert but I need help understanding form parts for Beat it by Michael Jackson. I understand generally when you‚Äôre looking line by line, but not when you‚Äôre talking about chorus and verse. 

For example if you look at the song, the first verse is 
‚ÄúThey told him, ""Don't you ever come around here""
""Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear""
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it""
This whole section would be form A.

""You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad""
This whole section would be form A
(Originally thought this was B)

Chorus 1 would be
‚ÄúJust beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right‚Äù
This section would be for B

Music,"As a person of a certain age, (50) it's my contention that Freddie Mercury had the most dynamic voice and stage presence that I've ever seen. The way he would have the crowd sing back to him was unbelievable. I saw Queen in concert as a young lad and there is nothing that can compare it, even all these years later.

When he died, my friends and I were so sad that it took us weeks to recover. Sounds strange since we didn't know him - but we felt deep down that his passing was the end of something magical. RIP Freddie",Freddie,1651217055,ueghq6

Music," For me its the Elliott Smith song Everybody Cares Everybody Understands from his XO album. I listened to the XO album a year ago and loved it but sadly did not revisit it until a few days ago. I found many more songs that I liked but none blew me way away like the way Everybody Cares Everybody Understands did. The part from the 2:34 minute mark is, my god, so satisfying to listen to. I;m actually a bit mad that I didn't pay attention to this song on my first listen (tho i guess that had to do with me listening to the album with one earphone bud due to tinnitus and being busy with work). The build-up and culmination of all those instruments (violins, cello, viola, electric guitar, piano and more!) are wondrous. Its just 2 minutes of pure ecstasy.

The instrumentals have a sort of subtle fury in them that matches Smith's anger in the song which makes me love it even more.

Just so you know: I have heard that the song is about Smith's friends trying to stage an intervention for him and his anger toward them for that.

here's the song if anyone wants to listen to it (id love to hear your thoughts on the song too if you have any) :
