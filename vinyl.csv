vinyl,ulzrod,AngelusNovus420,1,Seeking advice for a vinyl-ripping setup,"Hey,

I cultivate a modest collection of rare/obscure vinyl records which, to the best my knowledge, are not available anywhere on the Internet ‚Äî including Soulseek. Many aren't even documented on Discogs.

I do not yet personally own a turntable; I've been using my parent's vintage Panasonic turntable for listening purposes so far. I would like to purchase a setup that would allow me to produce a lossless digital copy of my records in order to make my collection available to a larger audience.

Apart from a Scarlet 2i2 audio interface and Presonus Eris E5 speakers, I don't believe I own any hardware that could be of any use in that setup. It would be ideal if the turntable had a built-in system facilitating the ripping process, but I don't want that to come at the cost of lower-quality core technology.

How much should I expect to pay for a decent setup? Do you have any specific recommendations?

Assistance would be greatly appreciated. Cheers!",0,1652126240

This is a generic microfiber cloth. Much cheaper than the microcloth specifically advertised for cleaning records here:

[https://www.amazon.com/Boundless-Audio-Record-Cleaning-Cloths/dp/B086YBLNSJ/ref=sr\_1\_3?crid=1DM2T7W30L21R&amp;keywords=record+cloth&amp;qid=1652121107&amp;sprefix=record+cloth%2Caps%2C93&amp;sr=8-3](https://www.amazon.com/Boundless-Audio-Record-Cleaning-Cloths/dp/B086YBLNSJ/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1DM2T7W30L21R&amp;keywords=record+cloth&amp;qid=1652121107&amp;sprefix=record+cloth%2Caps%2C93&amp;sr=8-3)

The only difference I can tell is the cheaper generic one is 85:15 Polyester:Nylon and the record microcloth is 65:35

I do not mind spending the extra money if it will actually make a difference.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I'm just use to cleaning my records with a cloth. Is it worth getting a record brush?

I put a vinyl, start, but instead of going to the edge and start playing, the arms goes straight to the middle of the record and go down. Ofc it doesnt work. If I try to force the arm to go down on the edge, it works perfectly (if it doesnt try to stop and go back to the arm holder.)

We are wondering if our collection of several hundred records will be susceptible to warping in the kind of heat that is likely to occur inside a Pod in the summer. We've considered moving our records in our cars instead, but we have small cars and enough records that it would be a real pain to do it that way. Packing them in the Pod is much preferable if the risk of damage is low.

There have been several threads on this topic posted over the years. I've seen some commenters caution against moving records in a pod over the summer, but others have said that they've done it with no problems, and the most important thing is to keep records out of direct sunlight (which they would be inside a Pod). I haven't seen anyone who said that they packed their records properly, moved them in a Pod over summer, and they still came out warped.

I‚Äôm a new record collector and I want to make sure my records are safe. I learned recently that records are not supposed to be in the sun and I wanted to check in if how I stored my records are okay?

I store some of my records on my wall without any sleeve. In the morning, cracks of sunlight leak through my blinds and they go on my records. I think the sunlight only goes on the records for less than an hour. My room doesn‚Äôt really get hot.

It‚Äôs a very mixed experience because it‚Äôs some of the artists best work, but isn‚Äôt a very complete and satisfying experience like an album is. However a few to me stand out as being worth it, maybe due to a mixture of hard availability or a huge amount of albums to collect that span decades and it‚Äôs hard to get all of them.

My two favorites I own are Bad Apples by the Smashing Pumpkins and What a Long Strange It‚Äôs been by the Grateful Dead. With the Smashing Pumpkins, it‚Äôs really hard to get a lot of their stuff and the actual set list on that collection is amazing, with almost every song that‚Äôs instrumental to the band. I‚Äôm a huge dead head but Long Strange Trip is a pretty good experience when I wanna listen to the dead, but either don‚Äôt wanna sit down and listen to a whole show or album, or I have people over who don‚Äôt enjoy the sometimes extremely long solos.",0,1652027465

Side B has 'LVR02408-13: and '#50', and the etchings aren't the same. The 8 on side A looks normal, while on side B it has an extra line, like when you are rushing to draw an 8, and you don't reconnect the top properly. Also, the (1) is tiny, and the parentheses are different sizes. This leads me to believe that this was manually etched into the vinyl. My question for reddit is 'does anyone else have a standard black copy like me, and if so, what is etched into yours?' also, does the #50 mean that I have the 50th copy produced?

Tatsuro Yamashita or ‚ÄòTatsu‚Äô, as he‚Äôs affectionately known in Japan, is a musical demigod - a wonderfully emotive songwriter, a pioneer of the city-pop style and a long-standing figurehead of contemporary Japanese music.  
Since he peeled away from the early group Sugar Babe, Tatsu has become an absolute icon in Japan (and in small pockets of the West). His first solo album, which I will trade my house for one day, goes for upwards of $6000 and is as rare as a glow-in-the-dark unicorn. Later albums of his are hardly cheap either and anyone who‚Äôs lucky enough to find his records at a good price should pull the trigger on that purchase quickfast.

  
I‚Äôve been collecting Tatsu‚Äôs stuff for years. Some of my favourite songs of all time are on these records - every album has something endearing and unique to offer. It‚Äôs hard to pick, but for the sake of brevity, here are some of my personal favourites:

  
‚Ä¢ For You: Arguably the definitive city pop blueprint, touting upbeat, funk-inspired rhythm sections, tight and bouncy horn arrangements and uplifting vocals. ‚ÄòSparkle‚Äô and ‚ÄòFutari‚Äô are absolute gems.  
‚Ä¢ Circus Town: Filled with warm, cutting percussion and tightly-wound backing vocals. It‚Äôs an album that speaks very clearly to Tatsu‚Äôs love for 60s and 70s American sounds. ‚ÄòWindy Lady‚Äô is a must-hear.  
‚Ä¢ Ride On Time: One of the most optimistic albums ever recorded, Ride On Time is filled with wonder, curiosity and honesty. The opening track, ‚ÄòSomeday‚Äô is one of my favourite songs - lovely horns, backing vocals and an undeniable rhythmic drive.  


A special mention has to go to Spacy which, aside from being a fantastic listen, also happens to be my favourite album cover!  


I‚Äôll be spinning Cosy and Moonglow today, two underrated offerings from the city pop boss. If you haven‚Äôt heard Moonglow, do it for the interludes alone. Are there any other Tatsuro geeks out there?",0,1651991137

vinyl,ukms5q,tomtea,1,The Cinematic Orchestra - Ma Fleur (15 years old todayüéÇ),"On 7th May 2007, The Cinematic Orchestra released Ma Fleur, I remembered being excited for this album. During the early 2000's, Ninja Tune was one of my top labels with albums by Mr Scruff, Herbaliser, DJ Vadim, DJ Food and by extension, Roots Manuva, Ty all getting heavy rotation. The album which I played the most and for about 1 year, every morning before I got out of bed, was The Cinematic Orchestra - Everyday.

Everything about that album vibed with me. The breakbeat/hip hop/jazz drum patterns, the vocalists, how they go from contemporary pop type songs like All That You Give/Everyday to mad instrumentals like Flite and the latter half of All Things To All Men. So, I was pretty hyped for Ma Fleur.

So, when I bought it and gave it a listen, I was pretty disappointed, the whole album was phrased differently. It was more abstract with building orchestral parts, less jazz/pop hooks but I kept listening to it on repeat and I'm glad it did as it's a beautiful piece which takes you on a journey and washes this sound and space over you. 

Genuinely one of my favourite albums and I was glad to see them play it like at The Roundhouse in Camden a few years later.",0,1651958711

My favorite reissue label, and that's saying something these days. Unfortunately, they don't seem to have any web presence whatsoever, and I generally have to find out about their releases via Light in the Attic (their distributor). Sadly, I didn't find out about the Hillbillies in Hell series until they were already up to vol. 9, and the first eight are way out of my price range.

So instead of complaining to myself, I decided to just start posting.  I started off buying classic rock stuff like alot of the people on the sub which quickly turned into trying to find my favorite hip-hop samples.  Now I'm mainly into Jazz-Funk-Soul-World stuff.  Here are a few records that I've picked up recently.

Gary Saracho- En Medio: Only record this guy put out.  Latin Psychedelic Jazz Funk.  It's really all over the place.. Favorite Track: ""Senor Baker""

Sunzoh Ohno- Bubbles: Japanese trumpet based Jazz with one track heavy Jazz-Funk.  Beautiful record front to back but Fav Track is the super funky ""Don't Get Down"".

Dom Um Romao- Spirit of the Times: Brazilian Jazz/Jazz-Funk/ Bossa Nova.  Dom is a drummer and percussionist which us why the album is really percussion heavy.  My fav fav track is the tune- ""Lamento Negro"".

Billy Foster and the Audio-  Private Press 80's boogie and Jazz funk.  It's soooooo good.  Entire album is a banger.  If you can only listen to one, check out Sometimes.  

Music Inc-  I am not as high on the Strata East label as others are.  Not really a big free jazz guy.  I like the idea of it, but it just isn't for me.  I digress.  This album is Hard Bop meets Modal jazz with some big band backings.  Really good with some really good jazz players on this album.  Check out ""Abscretions"".

Dave Pike- On a Gentle Note:  Dave Pike is a renowned Vibraphone player.  Have some of his other albums where it's more straight forward jazz that has a worldly flair to it.  Didn't know this album existed till recently.  It's all jazz funk ala Roy Ayers. Basically it's exactly the album I wanted him to make with out knowing he actually made it. Check out the first track ""Lazy Afternoon"".

This album takes the template laid by Levitate and makes it into a much more satisfying and muscular release, imho. First thing: Mark E. Smith's vocals are much clearer and his lyrics more complex than the cryptic snatches and repeated rants from the latter album. And the actual songwriting itself seems somehow more ""mature""; songs are actually arranged with flair and the covers on this are fucking brilliant--the scuzz-rockabilly of ""F-oldin' Money"" by Tommy Blake, ""This Perfect Day"" by The Saints and ""Bound"" by The Audio Arts. Bangers all.  
The sheer sonic attack of some of the hard breakbeat/nascent D&amp;B tracks on this LP are much more concentrated and less ""spread about"" than same on Levitate. ""Anecdotes And antidotes In B#"" is an utterly RINSED ""hard Breakbeat""/proto-junglist masterpiece and a total highlight...But one of my favourite, and certainly most surprising cuts on the LP is the final track ""On My Own"". A kind of Italio-Piano House track completely missing any beats whatsoever--the only rhythm occurring due to a wonderfully rolling, almost naked piece of aforementioned Piano House...I would never in a million years have thought I would enjoy what is basically beat-less Italian Disco-House but the beautifully rolling changes of these piece, along with MES's sympathetic vocal performance which just ""rrollls along"" with the instrumental track make this one of my favourite final tracks on any Fall studio LP. Just, fucking brilliant.  
Oh, and extra kudos for the absolutely heavy ""MES IN DUB"" track known as ""Finale: Tom Raggazzi"". Here Smithy acquits himself pretty damn fucking well with an attempt at ""ragga"" style Jamaican toasting...without sounding trite like String, Boy George, Snow or any of the other never-ending litanies of white men appropriating reggae vocal stylings....if anything he sounds closer to KRS-ONE circa Ghetto MUsic: The Blueprint (and that's no small fucking praise!)  
If you can pick this up for a good price then you're in for a treat and a fucking half. If not then buy the CD (but NOT the second LP pressing!!!)  
The production punch and ""polished"" songcraft of The Unutterable, the songwriting adventurousness of Levitate mulched together in this absolute masterpiece. Savage garage-rockabilly, unprecedented, muscularly-produced breakbeat/junglist/drum n' bass and fucking RAGGA combined with Italio-house stylings (and some kitchen sink but not as much as featured in Levitate!)  make The Marshall Suite one of the total highpoints of several latter-period Fall trilogies as good as ANYTHING the group ever released. A loud, crunching, wonderful continuation of it's predecessor, again built upon by the low-slung chugging pro-tools bass loops and psychobilly of The Unutterable.   


Gimme Levitate to The Unutterable. Gimme The REal New Fall LP to Imperial Wax Solvent--Heck!-give me Reformation! to Re-Mit!   
But The Marshall Suite is a DOUBLE-BASTARD of an LP and will make your life as a Fall fan immeasurably better!

vinyl,ujquh8,JerryFartcia,1,This has been bugging me for a bit. AITA for this interaction at the record store the other day regarding faulty merchandise,"Ok, so on RSD I picked up a copy of the Howard Wales release. Took it home and a few days later played it for the first time. It had a pretty bad warp to it causing the needle to move right to left and causing warbling sound. 

So I took it back and asked if they would mind exchanging it since they still had a copy. They took a look, kinda gave me the stink eye for inconveniencing them, and then realized the record was in fact pretty bad, so they exchanged it. As a sign of good faith and my appreciation, I even picked up another record while I was there, the recent rerelease of the Grateful Dead's Skull and Roses LP. 

Took it home, put it on the TT for a spin, and whaddya know, there's a nice deep scratch about a half inch long on sides C and D, causing about 3 minutes of popping on each side. So I packed it up, and brought it back the next day. 

Here's where it gets a little dicey. The owner of the shop immediately starts giving me shit. Talking about how he can't just send back faulty merchandise to the manufacturer, and that he takes the hit for every purchase returned. Which is fair, I get it. It sucks. At the same time though, I told him that I just don't see how that's my problem considering he sold me messed up records. 

He said something along the lines of ""well one return is one thing, but two returns on two days is a pattern"" and I was just gobsmacked. I asked him if he thinks I warped the first record in the 48 hours that I owned it, just to return it, while laughing a bit, not gonna lie. 

We were both pretty calm and polite and stuff during the interaction, it's not like we were yelling at eachother, but it's like, am I wrong here? The Dead record was $45. I feel like I shouldn't have to just suck up the cost just because I feel bad for those dudes small business. We ended up meeting in the middle and he exchanged it for a slightly cheaper record, but the whole thing left a really bad taste in my mouth.

vinyl,uixmdc,I_knew_a_guy_once,1,MOONER: Indonesian Psych Rock That Slaps,"Spinning my latest psych rock addition this morning. For those that don't know of them MOONER is an indonesian psych rock/hard rock super group. They're not hugely well known outside of their home country, but man does this shit slap hard - epic guitar riffs, hard driving bass, and some otherworldly vocals. 

They're definitely a mood spin, and as I prep for too many work meetings, I find myself spinning this record, letting the walls shake, and the sweet warping whines of amped up guitars reverberate. 

Here's a link to some info on the bad: [https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3jebe/psych-supergroup-mooner-debuts-with-a-stunning-music-video-as-heavy-and-trippy-as-their-sound](https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3jebe/psych-supergroup-mooner-debuts-with-a-stunning-music-video-as-heavy-and-trippy-as-their-sound)

Best of all, their vinyl is relatively undiscovered but still in press - so you can pick it up nice and cheap. A bargain for the epic nature of their tunes. 

I can only hope they will play live on the East Coast sometime so I can rock out to them live.

Should I order, or wait til‚Äô I get home since I keep seeing for subreddits (VG,Anime, this one) some damaged packaging from USPS or should I give it to someone to keep, then ship it down??

These are mostly good to great recordings in decent condition. It‚Äôs a mix, but there are mostly symphonies (Brahms, Beethoven, Shostakovich, Mahler) and concertos (Prokofiev, Rachmaninov, Tchaikovsky), and emphasis on string and piano solo pieces. I also have 20th century stuff.

If you are interested, DM me your address and how many records you‚Äôd like to get, up to six LPs. I will write you back with the postage price and how to pay.  I‚Äôm open to requests, and I can let you know if I can fulfill them, so it will be more a surprise bag. That said, I picked out these records one by one and didn‚Äôt just take home anything. They almost all either sound great, are a favorite piece of mine, seemed like a rare find, etc. Just please don't ask, if I have Catalog Number X of Conductor Y and Composer Z. Some of these are worth some money, but it's not like I'll be sending you the Ansermet ""Royal Ballet"" release on RCA.

vinyl,ugimhl,ssbperidot,1,My mom's co-worker gifted me an entire collection for free. Here are the highlights!,,0,1651470078
vinyl,ughpgk,Kashawinshky,1,Remembering,"I‚Äôm going to take a wild guess and say my story not unique. I‚Äôll start by saying I don‚Äôt think of myself as an audiophile or even an avid hobbyist. In a way I‚Äôve just been accumulating ;)

As a pre-preteen I bought 2 things with babysitting money: Blue Cheer‚Äôs Summertime Blues 7‚Äù, and Moody Blues‚Äô Days of Future Passed (&amp; later Every Good Boy, destroyed by my sister). Later I bought or was gifted an album here and there, like Born to Run, and Tomita‚Äôs Snowflakes are Dancing. My boyfriend at the time made a turntable for me and gave me some old speakers and a receiver from his band. 

It wasn‚Äôt until after I came home from 1-1/2 years in England, heard some great non-AOR music, and had my own little paycheck that I started building a collection. A boyfriend from that time convinced me to buy some new components, and I still have most of those decades later, today: an SL-D1 turntable, a Marantz tape deck, and my Technics box speakers. 

A little later my friends and yet another boyfriend went into NY almost every weekend to Sounds (St. Marks) digging through the bins. I have so many records still with that big red circle price sticker on the cover. After Sounds, we‚Äôd go kind of around the corner to a step-down shop that had an Amazing collection of punk &amp; obscure 7‚Äù, like Justin Love/Trouble, TSOL, March Violets, etc. One of our friends was a DJ at The Meadowbrook, and we‚Äôd go early to help him unload the milk cartons, so I also developed an early love for extended version 12‚Äù, especially after he started playing more and more reggae before the club opened. We all had similar but different tastes, so after buying records we‚Äôd hang out and play a couple from everybody‚Äôs haul, sitting in thick smoke and seeing if any secret messages were etched in the runouts lol. We made a lot of straight and mixed tapes for each other with all this stuff. Some paper inner sleeves that I kept had ‚ÄúMixed tapes are killing music‚Äù printed on them. 

A year or so ago I got a new cartridge (red 2M). Recently I re-designed my whole audio/visual setup to have everything more accessible. This year I got a new low-end Sony receiver and new spool of all-copper speaker wires. I was choice-limited by the combo of budget and needing a phono line accepting bare wires. My LPs have almost always been on a Hejne (Ikea) shelf unit. Originally taking up 4 shelves snugly, now down to 3-1/2 after a donation about 10 years ago. 

Right now I‚Äôm going through all of them again, doing a wet cleaning by hand. I‚Äôm also playing them as I go, rediscovering why I bought them in the first place. As I listen I‚Äôm also grateful that I always took care of my records, thanks to that first boyfriend who made a turntable for me and taught me how to handle them, and that my mother was wrong to stack 4 albums at a time. I still have my original Discwasher (fluid is long gone). During my heavy-buying phase, I also bought a lot of VRP inner sleeves. 

Sometimes, just curious, I go on discogs to see if anyone else values something as much as I do. Someone was selling a Yellowman album that I have, for over $400, which seems absolutely wild to me. This sub is great for looking at the covers and maybe going down a rabbit hole on a recommendation. I‚Äôm still new here and I‚Äôve seen some posts about ‚Äújust getting into vinyl,‚Äù so I thought I‚Äôd share just a little of what it was like for me.",0,1651466423

I started sharing my love of vinyl with my wife's kids and her brother. I would take them into my mancave and try to educate them on active critical listening. How to train your ears to hear a specific instrument. How to tell an open soundstage from a more intimate direct one. Teaching them how to handle vinyl records and store them as well as setting up the turntable and how a different cartridge or phono stage dramatically affects the listening experience.

They are both now in their 20s and have their own turntables and vinyl collections. It makes me extremely proud!",0,1651459455

vinyl,ug9exg,Facelift13,1,Why is vinyl so angry?,"We are a part of the greatest hobby out there. We are collectors, audiophiles, reviewers, and caretakers.

So what's with all the anger?

I see new people joining this glorious hobby everyday and they immediately get dumped on because they didnt buy the right turntable or they only listen to mainstream music or they posted a picture of a new album and that album gets posted about everyday. But it's new to them. They are excited about it . It means something to them.

I am not sure why we aren't more welcoming. Gatekeeping is for a$$holes. I personally want vinyl to thrive even more than it is. My wife's children listen to vinyl because of me and I want their kids to listen to Vinyl because of them.

Obviously some people need to be educated about the nuances of turntables and vinyl and we should pass along that information to them but in a respectful non condescending way.

I love this hobby and this subreddit and want to see it shine. Maybe it's just me.",0,1651439177

The seller described the condition well, but I politely requested a couple of photos, as I've read too many Discogs horror stories. He sent back a message basically refusing, and seemed a bit irritated by the request. It seems odd, as it takes five seconds to take a picture with a phone, and the fact that it's somewhat rare and, for me, relatively expensive, makes my request seem completely ordinary.

vinyl,ufl85j,vndrewcharles,1,I'm getting increasingly jaded with collecting vinyl and having thoughts about selling my collection,"I got serious about collecting vinyl in the beginning of 2018, and am currently sitting at around 250 records with a smaller cassette collection on the side. Nothing crazy, but enough. I'm passionate about music first and foremost, I love the ""hands on"" aspect with each record and have gotten so much enjoyment from it. I've accumulated a diverse collection with some pretty rare gems and timeless classics. To this minute it's one of my favorite and most rewarding hobbies, but I realized recently that I'm at a crossroad for where I go with collecting vinyl. Ever since the pandemic substantially encouraged and contributed to FOMO in an already competitive resale market my collection according to discogs has appreciated in value to the price of a used car. For a handful of reasons, that *pisses me off.* 


It's nothing new to anyone that mainstream albums are OOP due to supply chain issues, but seeing endless flippers immediately buy up restocks to make a profit off of someone who missed the opportunity to buy something at MSRP or on RSD has always left such a bad taste in my mouth, and it's made me subconsciously paranoid when I use my own records to where I find myself thinking ""don't damage it, I don't want to pay a flipper to replace it."" Because I've done just that, dropped a generic repress I bought for $40 only two months ago that's now selling for double at the minimum. With my more rare &amp; limited records that sense increases even further to where it takes away the enjoyment of the music a lot of the time (I maintain the philosophy to listen to everything in my collection no matter the value however). Looking at my records overall just sitting on a shelf is becoming somewhat of a mental burden anymore when I think about the ""what if?"" scenarios of it getting damaged in a natural disaster, by a four-legged friend, a future kid, someone vengeful, etc. never mind the objective fact it's an absolute PITA to move between living spaces and take care of.


What got me thinking on all of this was trading in about two dozen records a few weeks ago and how good it felt to get them out of the way. One side of me wants to continue my love of music by collecting more records despite the cons, enjoying the sentimentality associated with getting each one, yet another side of me would find it very freeing to not have to have them weigh me down literally and figuratively anymore. I'm curious to what peoples' thoughts and experiences are with selling off whole collections because it's gotten to a point where simplifying life has becoming very appealing.",0,1651356319

did use the search, also had a read on Google and now equipped with the research I have reached some conclusions, but I would love if some more experienced users could please verify if I got it correct:

1) vinyl vs CD sound quality - not better, but different. Vinyl contains a fuller spectrum of sound but introduces noise and CDs have much less noise but cut off certain frequencies. Is that correct?
2) in order to get a sound as true to the actual performance of the artist, I should be looking for vinyls that came out before the digitalisation of the industry, because the chances are modern re-issues are just new pressings of the digitalised (flattened spectrum) tracks
3) vinyl records and produces a continuous sound wave vs CDs and digital in general ‚Äúchop‚Äù the wave at 44.1 kHz - kinda like frames per second in a movie - therefore vinyl  will contain a truer representation of the recording provided it was mastered for the vinyl not digitally

I am not an audiophile and I can‚Äôt hear those differences but I would like to get ‚Äúas close to the artist‚Äù as possible. I mostly listen to swing / jazz.

Many thanks",1,1651312642

vinyl,udlbgb,madshm3411,1,Does anyone have insight on how exactly the vinyl supply chain works? I‚Äôm very curious.,"New-ish to collecting vinyl, like so many people in the last 3-5 years.  Lately, I‚Äôve been ultra curious about the inner workings of how the supply chain works - how records get selected to be pressed, how rights work, how distribution works, etc.  Does anyone have insider insight into the process of how records get selected to be pressed and how they eventually make it into stock?

The reason I ask - the first record I bought was in 2017, the OkNotOk version of Ok Computer.  It was everywhere.  Now, 5 years later, it‚Äôs sold out everywhere because demand is up - but occasionally, I‚Äôve seen it pop up in limited restocks.  Where are these copies coming from?  Are they leftover copies that have been sitting at a distributor for this long and they are slowly seeing the light of day?  Or are they new pressings?

Taking another Radiohead example - Pablo Honey, which is an album that was also everywhere back in 2017, was sold out in a lot of places recently.  Again, due to increased demand, I get that.  But all of a sudden, there was a surge of restocks in much greater quantities than OkNotOk.  I assume this was a large scale repress and the market got flooded with a bunch of new copies?

Then, taking a different example - Blink-182‚Äôs self titled album is very hard to find lately, and I don‚Äôt recall seeing many of them even back before the surge.  I‚Äôve found all their other albums recently, but self-titled seems to be one that is not getting repressed.  Is this a rights issue?  Basically, if this record would sell super fast if it came back in stock, why isn‚Äôt it getting a repress?  Is it purely that records like Pablo Honey got in the queue ahead of Blink 182 and there‚Äôs a huge backup?

And then, what determines when something gets a repress vs. a full reissue?  Obviously anniversary releases with additional content or a full remastering makes sense.  But why do we often see record companies doing a reissue when something could just be repressed from the same masters?  

Would love any insight, I‚Äôm very intrigued and curious to understand how it works.",0,1651115427

I just bought Everlast's WFSTB for $37 from ebay.  I'm good

How much do the flippers really make here?

Honestly its not worth my time to get in line and wait.

I support my local shops, all day.  but how much did these records cost?

Is it worth it for flippers to gobble them up to make $8, $10?

I'm good.  I know I missed out on getting a chance to flip a Tay-Tay record for $125, but at the end of the day I would rather see Taylor Swift fans get the records they were waiting for and is it worth it to flip all these other records?  I think my time is more valuable than this...",0,1651033730

vinyl,ucl8x0,Proper-Jaguar-4036,1,What do I need to connect ITT HiFi 9610 turntable to Denon AVR X3400H,"Hello all,

I plan on upgrading my Denon 2310 to a Denon X3400H for my cinema/music setup (Elac B6 for speakers).   
Currently I can plug in my  ITT HiFi 9610 turntable directly into the phono output, sadly the X3400H doesn't have a phono input. I read a few things about connecting a turntable to a non-phono input receiver and I'm completely lost, partially because of the preamp and the normal amp and partially because there is no information about the turntable (to find out if it has a (pre)amp). 

Can someone tell me what I need to buy to connect my turntable to the new receiver? It doesn't need to be top of the line hardware at all, I rather have a cheaper (pre)amp, but of course it should deliver quite nice/good quality sound (about what I had when it was connected to the Denon 2310).   
What do I need to buy/what do you recommend?

Thanks all in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

BTW I know that the Denon X3500H has a phono, but those are way harder to find and more expensive. And I also know the basic principles of the turntable, that an eq has to be applied etc. but I'm still lost.",0,1651003080

Now, I don‚Äôt know much about his taste in music, but I know that he really loves those super cheesy eurodance type songs from the 90‚Äôs. Songs like Blue Da Ba Dee by Eiffel 65 or Mirror Mirror by Solid Base.

vinyl,ubills,PermanentFlaneur,1,Exotica: Mono vs. Stereo: The Return,"A few months ago I inquired if anyone had any information about the differences between the mono and stereo recordings of early exotica albums. Since then I‚Äôve done some more digging and found some spicy info regarding Capitol Record‚Äôs recording process around 1956 - 1958, when stereo was still in its infancy, but quickly becoming popular. At this time, Capitol Record‚Äôs method of recording mono was, if you would pardon my French, some real serious shit. They would use close-mic techniques with eight microphones/channels during a recording session to capture every nuance of a performance. This is why Capitol‚Äôs albums in the 50s have such a ""rich"" sound. Starting in 1956, they began casting caution to the goddamn wind and started simultaneously hanging two or three mics overhead for their stereo releases. So basically, they were recording one session using two very different methods, and releasing two very different sounding versions of an album‚Äì a more defined, intimate mono release, and a more ambient and sweeping stereo release. Les Baxter‚Äôs sessions for¬† ‚ÄúPorts of Pleasure,‚Äù ‚ÄúSpace Escapade,‚Äù ‚ÄúSouth Pacific,‚Äù and ‚ÄúAfrican Jazz‚Äù were all recorded in this fashion. Most of these albums can be found for five bucks, and I recommend picking them up and hearing the differences for yourself. For me, it has been fun comparing them. I‚Äôm sure Liberty and other labels were doing something similar at the time, and I‚Äôll be picking up some more mono and stereo versions of Martin Denny to compare soon. I could go on and on about this but nobody has time for that. Have a great Monday everyone.",0,1650884932

vinyl,uammrc,rickmarin,1,RSD pricing,"My one complaint about RSD is how they're pricing 2-LP sets as if they're 2 individual records (going for around a $25-$28 price point). So close to or above $50 for a 2-record set (such as the Stones-More Hot Rocks which was around $60). But having worked in several record stores years ago I can attest that wasn't how 2LP sets were priced. They were only SLIGHTLY higher than single albums (with rare exceptions like Pink Floyd The Wall &amp; Zep-Physical Graffiti which were priced based on their demand &amp; also having 2 full volumes of great material musically..also the packaging). This especially applied to live albums. So for example Rush-Moving Pictures may have been $7.99-$8.99 but then Exit..Stage Left was priced around $11.99 being a live double-album.

It's mostly price gouging. From the top down. They were gouging pre-covid/shortages. It's also the fact they no longer MASS produce vinyl on a scale they did back before CDs took over. That was how Tower Records &amp; chains like them existed. They used to move massive volumes of vinyl every week. You'd walk in there and there were stacks &amp; stacks of just NEW releases every week. And people were going through them like they were at a discount flea market grabbing as much as they could afford.

RSD is basically that, but on a much smaller scale, catering to a more selective &amp; eclectic clientele",0,1650774117

It was an early show/date with my wife so it‚Äôs got a lot of sentimental value for me as well. Trouble is I bought the album on vinyl back in 2009 and the mix is godawful. It sounds like every song was produced by a different person, the highs and lows are over the map. Some songs are fine but certain ones sound completely blown out and muddy to the point of distraction. It never goes on my turntable because it‚Äôs just sonically wretched.

I noticed on discogs that there is a 2019 reissue (on sexy colored vinyl to boot!)‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I was wondering if anyone has listened to this version. Was it remixed/remastered? How‚Äôs the sound. If its any better I‚Äôm planning to swap my copy, but if it‚Äôs the same then I won‚Äôt bother.

Anyone got any ears on this one?",0,1650754310

vinyl,ua49f8,mr_man01,1,How to fix sibilance?,"Hi Everyone! 

I‚Äôve had a Mary Ann record player from auna for about a year and a half now, and from day one I had issues with what I think is sibilance. Basically on hard ‚ÄòS‚Äô and ‚ÄòT‚Äô sounds or on heavy symbol crashes, I get a scratchy or staticky noise out of the speakers. This doesn‚Äôt happen when I use the BT or CD function on it. 

It has improved the more I use it, but still features regularly on some of my records, regardless of whether they‚Äôre second hand or not. Was wondering if this is a common or uncommon issue, or if there‚Äôs any ways I can fix or improve the sound? 

I‚Äôve already replaced the needle on it, but that didn‚Äôt do much at the time. I‚Äôve read somewhere before that it could be an issue with the cartridge, but I‚Äôm not sure if I can replace the one I have, and if I can what I should replace it with.

Any help or advice is more than welcome!
Here‚Äôs a link to the model I have: https://www.hifi-tower.ie/Mary-Ann-Turntable-33-45-78-rpm-CD-DAB-FM-BT-USB-Black-Grey.html?listtype=search&amp;searchparam=auna%20Mary%20Ann

But recently i've been wanting to get back into it and honestly, it's not really a sound thing for me. I collected because of my deep love of music and i enjoyed investing my money into it. I also like the idea of having a library of my favorite music out on display. 

Only thing that's been kind of holding me back is that i've noticed that everything has gone up since i've been gone. I used Amazon a lot to buy my records back then, and when i look at the same records now, some have gone up almost 3 times in price or it seems a lot of the albums i once had are now harder to find. 

So i'm kind of kind of hesitate...but i'm still leaning towards the ""do it"" side of things. I was thinking of just getting a few essential albums i like and waiting for things to drop hopefully.",0,1650696873

Obvious preface: Every shopper is different with different needs, wants, and desires! OK, now that we've got the obvious out of the way...

I visited a good amount of record stores over 2 days.

I scout out for good deals on generally used rock of all types. Honestly, super wide tastes from anything from Beach Boys, to Black Sabbath, to Oingo Boingo, to Harry Nilsson, to Kraftwerks. Maybe a little basso nova Jazz mixed in.

I will grade stores on 3 important criteria based on the records I generally look for:

Price. The standard bearer of price is discogs. A business being most fair to you is selling a record based on on historical data. A business being slightly less fair (but acceptable IMO) is selling a record for a current equivalent price on discogs. A business being an arsehole is by selling you a record that is higher than equivalent record and sprinkling more on top.

Selection. No one wants to walk into a record store and find nothing. Since I am a used buyer, it‚Äôs important to have a nice used selection that is being refreshed at a usual cadence. I typically will avoid stores that focus only on new records, especially the common variety.

Suave. Just the overall atmosphere. Cool people working? Nice music playing? Cool posters? Serve beer? Just a cool place to be while you browse?

Here we go!

&amp;#x200B;

Decator

Wuxtry

I would say this shop has mostly used records. There's a wall behind the counter of higher value records that appeared to be a bit over priced. I think I remember seeing ""The Who - Who's Next"" for $50 (or maybe it was $80). There was another one up there too (I think it was Sticky Fingers for $100).

Price: C+. Prices were generally comparable to current discogs listings but with shipping included in the price. The high value records appeared to be even more overpriced. Inflated prices, for sure.

Selection: B. Records felt a little picked through, not containing very many, if at all of more common bigger hitter rock records. The only thing I found was a Harry Nillson album that I was missing for about $10. 

Suave: B. I was one of the first to enter the store with two employees so I didn't get to listen to any tunes. It's pretty jammed packed with records in there, but lots of low-end variety.

Total records purchased: 1

Ella Guru

This was instantly better than Wuxtry. Smaller selection and store, but everything is far more curated. You get a sense of what's there is all good. This would be the store I would visit weekly due to price and selection.

Price: B+. Prices were generally spot on to discogs minus shipping. I found a VG+ - NM TML pressing of the Wall for $30 (the nicest OG press I have ever seen). Got a superb copy of Michael Jackson's Thriller for $20, and a really nice copy of Strange Days for $15. These are just solid prices and also solid records.

Selection: B. Their selection is limited, but as mentioned it's curated. Nothing crappy goes in there. They even had a copy of ""The Who - Who's Next"" (which is not as common as I'd hope) for about $10 or so, but condition was a little under what I would have liked.

Suave: A. Cool atmosphere, cool music, clean store, and a really nice owner. I liked him so much I sold him some records before I left.

Total records purchased: 4.

&amp;#x200B;

Little Five points

Criminal Records

This is probably the most popular store in Atlanta. There's usually a line to be able to go inside. The store has tons of incredible flair. This is obviously where the largest Record Store Days events happen. This is the place to go if you're looking for new records. Used records? Read on...

Price: C+. I could not gauge used prices since I couldn‚Äôt find anything used that I knew about. It seems like used prices are a bit inflated, but not astronomically so. Pricing for new records are typically a little over Amazon or whatever. That's common for many stores. 

Selection: D. This is not the place to go for Used records as the new records overpower the used record selection by 4:1. You basically have a small selection on the far end of the store to look through, and man I flipped through everything since I really wanted to find something.  I suppose if you're after used and if you lived close by, you can bounce in from time to time and maybe find something, but this is definitely not my type of record store.

Suave: A. Definitely the ""fanciest"" record store of them all. Tons of flair posted about. Some cool display cases of higher value records. Lots of posters and what-not to buy.

Total records purchased: 0

Wax N' Facts

Right around the corner from Criminal is Wax N' Facts. They have TONS of records (most of them are not going to be sleeved). The vast majority of records are going to be low value records however, so if you're after higher hitters (think Black Sabbath, Queen, or the likes) then you're really not going to find much here. However, if you're after stuff that isn't of high value, but maybe just hard to locate, this may be the perfect store for you. It's a big, musty record store with tons to look through!

Price: A. Records are superbly priced. I found a brand new Nilsson album for $12 in shrink. Prices on everything here is typically discogs minus shipping and I'm sure there's quite a few examples of even cheaper than that.

Selection: C+. Selection is tough to rate for this store since my list had stuff like ""Oingo Boingo"" on it and some harder to find Beach boys stuff. I just couldn't find much in here. They don't have a high-value selection either, so you really just have to dig and hope for the best. Lots of ""dad rock"" stuff like ""BTO"" and ""Three Dog Night"" stuff all over the damned place in here for a few bucks. If this is your dig, then you'd probably put an ""A"" here. I couldn't find any bossa nova jazz at all in here. I did however see someone infront of me find ""Beach Boys - Party!"" which was what I was looking for (and really difficult to find) so I was a bit bummed out on that! 

Suave: B+. It's a musty record store in a really cool location, so what more can you want!

Total records purchased: 2

&amp;#x200B;

Buckhead

FantasyLand Records

Probably the largest record store in Atlanta. But largest doesn't mean best! I'm a bit torn how I feel about this store as I think they simply lack having quality records.

Price: C+ - B. Yes, I‚Äôm giving a range. I've seen examples of inflated pricing but also pretty decent priced stuff in value bins. I can't really gauge the price much because I couldn't find anything I wanted and I searched this store far and wide.

Selection: C. The store is so massive, and is filled with records. Rooms and rooms of them! The problem is that everything feels pretty picked through, and the vast majority are low-value records! As I mentioned, I had a large list of a wide variety stuff and this store had zero chance of providing anything for it. I ended up with a couple Soundtracks that were ""OK"" priced, but it was a chore even finding those. They didn't have a ""high value"" wall either. This store is similar to Wax N Facts in that the majority of records are low value stuff that require some digging. I did like how they seperate used vs new.

Suave: A. The owner is really nice and approachable. They had lots of beach boys playing, so it was kinda my type of store. 

Total Records purchased: 2

&amp;#x200B;

Marietta

Sweet Melissa Records

My most hated record store on my whole trip. The layout, organization, and cleanilness is incredible, but the prices are out of this world. This may have been the most expensive record store I have ever seen across 4 differents tates.

Price: F. Absolutely the highest prices in my trip. It is rare to find a low value record under $10 here. Prices were Dicogs + Shipping + 40% on top. 

Selection: C+. They keep a bunch of low value records. I absolutely couldn't find anything on my list (I keep bringing up ""my list"" but I have about 35 records on my list, all 70s-80s stuff which shouldn't be hard to find in a place like this). No black sabbath, no Stan Getz of any sort, no Kraftwork, no Motley Crue, no Queen, etc). The only cool thing I found in there is they had 8 autographed Ry Cooder albums, but get this: $80 each. They are absolutely nuts.

Suave: C. I think it's cool that they have equipment that they sell (that seems reasonable priced) and they seem to be the place to go if you're wanting to get into ways of listening to records. They seem like really nice people and there was always some good music playing. But it really just doesn't shake them being an extremely overpriced antique store. 

Total Records purchased: 0. Looked and got the hell out of there.

&amp;#x200B;

The Battery

Waterloo Sunset

One of my favorite record stores. I stayed right next to it so I visited 3 times. Everything about this store is a good example of what a record store should have.

Price: B+. Prices were very comparable to current Discogs. I picked up Yes Time and a Word for $15, a hard to find Nilsson album for $9, American Pop Soundtrack for $7, and an Astrud Gilberto album for $6. I also picked up a new Ry Cooder live album for $15. No inflation going on here, prices being sold pretty much right at Discogs value (without shipping). It's incredible that they price things solid like this being in the Battery.

Selection B+: While the used rock and used Jazz isn't ""huge"", they seem to get stuff in every single day so the used bins are great to check. Their new selection isn't half-bad either and I like that they separate used vs new. You're bound to find something in here. They actually have a small japanese and Mofi section, so really huge bonus!

Suave: B+. Just a solid record store with great music, a nice workers  that just lets you browse and enjoy yourself. They even gave me a tour. Hard to not like this place.

Total Records purchased: 5

I also went to the atlanta record show and picked up several things there that you will see included in the photo below.

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully this helps any future travelers or even any locals! My favorite stores are Ella Guru and Waterloo Sunset.

I'm looking for a poly 'trifold' gatefold sleeve that allows me to view the inside cover art of the increasing number of triple disc releases that are coming out. I wish to do this without having to remove the cover from it's sleeve. 

Planete Disque here in Europe have finally produced one (I believe they're the first):  
[https://www.planetedisque.com/en/record-outer-sleeves/1058-pvc-record-sleeve-12-inch-triple-gatefold-lp-6096444179109.html](https://www.planetedisque.com/en/record-outer-sleeves/1058-pvc-record-sleeve-12-inch-triple-gatefold-lp-6096444179109.html)

But... they're PVC. Man do I hate PVC covers. They're dull, stiff, ugly and thick, (coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere)

Oh and they're 4 euros *each!*

A FEW things?!?  A vinyl album, two copies of what must be everyone of their albums on CD and what looks like a 45.

my local store have received  
80 of of the vinyl i want, a large amount of number for this particular item.

my plan is too arrive at 5:30 with the intent to pick up a copy, is this too late? should i be there earlier? 
i believe as long as my place in the queue doesn‚Äôt exceed 80, my odds are really good?

i also know the demand is high for this item, and i‚Äôm concerned i should be factoring the possibility that people will be there just for the item, and they‚Äôll come down to my store because they have so many copies. 

i‚Äôm not sure if i‚Äôm overthinking, if i‚Äôm right, or if i‚Äôm going wayyyyy too late, and i should be there at like 3am,

Beastie Boys are releasing a 4 LP boxset packed w/ demos and filler.

Nirvana seems to pump out a similar box every year...

These are just a couple of examples of what is becoming a de facto move for all legacy acts and ""classic"" albums.

I've said it before and I'll keep saying it. These bloated box sets (packed w/ unnecessary filler) from tired legacy acts are the reason pressing plants are so backed up and quality control is down. We can't complain about these pressing plant issues and clap like seals and drop coin every time a new one is announced.

I love these albums as much as the next person, but it's reaching a point of excess that is just silly and dumb. Wouldn't it make more sense to put all those demos, b-sides and live tracks on like a jump drive or a CD instead. That way pressing plants can prioritize other releases that are worthy of the format.

I've been looking into investing in a record cleaning machine and wanted to hear everyone's thoughts on them. Do they drastically improve a record's sound (pops, crackles, static, etc.)? 

If a vinyl is just scratched, what kind of sound does that make, just a skip? And would a cleaning machine help with that?

Would love to hear everyone's thoughts and/or recommendations. Thanks all!",0,1650511979

As you might guess, not a lot of budget, so I was thinking about getting an LP60X.  
I also found this Victrola (yes, the same one that makes those crappy suitcase players) VPRO-2000 which has anti-skate adjustment, counterweight and interchangeable cartridge, the thing is that the price point is way too good that it scares me. There aren't really that many reviews of it out there, could be that it is just a horrible knock-off of the Technics 1200

I do not necessarily believe VINYL sounds better than properly engineered digital audio, but there is a certain quality to it that I can pick up on - the natural reverberation heard in the silence being one of them. I think with a digital ""compressed"" copy, the same silence (and any natural reverberation within it) would be lost because it would be beneath a certain threshold, a threshold that does not exist on an analog recording with deeper room for even the most subtle waveforms to be heard.

I need a copy of Bauhaus's Burning From The Inside, released in 1983. It's really not uncommon to find this record in a used record street market, whether you are not probably going to find the exact 1st UK press and the perfect mint condition. More likely some later 80s reissue, VG conditions or so, you know. I might be able to find one of these for 20-30 ‚Ç¨ (I'm from Italy). 
Meanwhile, an official 2018 reissue campaign of their entire discography made available on any store these newly remastered records both on the music side and the graphic side, nicely too it seems. Prices go from 19 to 30 ‚Ç¨.

I'm thinking about fixing my dads old Vinyl player. There's not much i know about it and i would love it if someone could tell me anything about it. Basically the thing i've found online is this one record player that's for sale on the site i will put the link below. I'll also put a photo of the one being sold in this post.  


It would be awesome finding a manual for it but unfortunately i haven't found it online, and i think my dad bought it used, so it probably didn't come with it.   


Lets see where this takes us :)

Unfortunately, the one i've got doesn't look this good, and it's missing the glass dust cover, but i think it has the potential of looking almost this good.

They moved the copy for sale to another account (Same insane sale price, showed up day I told them I was going to bitch about their shenanigans)...

I just replaced it with an Ortofon Red and either I didn‚Äôt do something right or maybe that cartridge isn‚Äôt the greatest?

Regardless of the album, there is definitely a bit more crackling and slight background hiss.

If the album is a really good pressing, it sounds fantastic (aside from the light hiss and pop)‚Ä¶ but older quality albums (ie Steely Dan Aja) have a much more pronounced hiss and pop.

Is this a calibration issue or just the Red?

And if it‚Äôs just the Red, does anyone have a recommendation for something else that would provide a better listening experience?",0,1650301667

Fluance is currently running a sale making the RT81 $199 ($100 less than the RT82). Anyone with more knowledge of these want to sway me in the right direction here?",0,1650298363

vinyl,u6e1kz,Beatlemaniac__,1,Record still playing through one channel when the volume is mute,"I was at my grandparents house the other day and ended up stumbling upon their old record player and their record collection. I decided to try playing one of them and it sounded incredibly good considering the player hasn‚Äôt been used in roughly 40 years. Anyway, at one point I was playing it at a slightly quieter volume and noticed that the sound was getting slightly distorted. I turned the volume down even more, and found that when the volume is at mute, the record is still playing through one channel and INCREDIBLY scratchy. It‚Äôs not noticeable at all when the record is being played at a normal volume but it still worries me that one of the channels is messed up like that. I‚Äôm a total noob when it comes to vinyl so I just want to know: Is this normal? Does it damage the record? And how can I fix it? The model is a technosonic MT-PH02 if that helps.",0,1650290936

[Now playing: an original 1977 T-Neck\/CBS pressing of The Isley Brothers' 1977 masterpiece, Go for Your Guns.](https://preview.redd.it/b8oe02r6myt81.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d26459b8b58e1cb7d701e7f3b2b579160979774)

Many often cite The Isley Brothers solely as a soul and funk band. While there's no way to understate their impact as soul and funk masters, their roots have firmly been in rock &amp; roll since the late '50s (they're just as vital to shaping and shifting rock music than they're typically credited for -- so much so that there's still those that don't know pre-fame Jimi Hendrix was once the featured guitarist in their band.) By the time this album came out, the Isleys underwent several reinventions and proved their staying power as soul-funk hitmakers, but they also had Ernie Isley in the fold. An all-time underrated great whose guitar wizardry summoned a brew of Jimi Hendrix's Black psychedelic magic, Eddie Hazel's freewheeling funk ferocity, and the bluesy wails of B.B. King, Buddy Miles, and Albert King, Ernie showed all his cards all over this album (even going so far as playing all the drums.) The result was a faultless gem of late-period psychedelic soul, which boasted tough funk-rock built around baby brother Marvin Isley's hefty speaker-rumbling slap bass and a pair of all-time boudoir soul classics, including the greatest song ever written about infidelity, ""Footsteps in the Dark"" and the mystical prog-soul epic, ""Voyage to Atlantis."" No one can miss with this one.",0,1650145234

My band received test presses today and we were quite shocked at how different it sounded depending on the turntable.  


The first one we tried (Belt-drive) the pitch was really lower and tempo was quite slower (5-10 bpm slower per songs than the original recording). We thought there was a problem with the pressing.  


Then we tried on a different belt-drive at a friends place. The tempo was much better, but just a little bit faster than the original recording. We didn't know what to think anymore about the pressing and were quite confused.  


Than we tried on a 3rd turntable - a direct drive. And everything was perfect.  
Does this mean that the direct drives are much more reliable ? That the belt drive were just setup the wrong way ? 

What's are your general experiences ? At this point IDK if the pressing is fine or not!",0,1650029248

Another issue I‚Äôve had is that two vinyls that I‚Äôve boughten from Amazon sound weird. And it‚Äôs only these two. Whenever I play them they sound a bit slow and the artists voice sounds a bit more deeper. Now it is weird to me that it‚Äôs only happening to the vinyls I bought off of Amazon but for all I know it could be normal or because of another thing. I looked it up and people said it could be my players belt that‚Äôs the issue but I keep thinking that if the player is the issue than why isn‚Äôt it happening with the rest of my vinyls.

I ordered a KAB EV-1 RCM after reading all those comments about records being dirty and about how vacuum cleaning a record can supposedly improve a VG  record to VG+ and such, but to be honest I didn't actually notice any improvement.

What puzzles me about one of these LPs (Paul Desmond's Glad to be Unhappy) is that the wax actually sounds quiet, as in, the quiet parts of the song sound silent, but when a vocal or instrument comes in, it sounds super ""scratchy."" Hopefully that description makes sense. There isn't really that much crackling, but it's still unlistenable. 

Is that a sign of the grooves being worn? Is it really just dirt that I have to keep scrubbing away?

[Most of these records are reissues as I was buying CDs for the most part during the 90s.  Ironically, the worst sounding record of the lot \(De La Soul Is Dead\) IS an original, which I bought brand new when it came out \(for like twelve bucks\).  As vinyl was an extremely niche thing in the early '90s, production quality wasn't really a top priority so they squeezed just over thirty minutes per side, and that's even after eliminating a few tracks from the CD + cassette version\).  The only other original is Flood by They Might Be Giants.  Mellon Collie is the unofficial repress on blue vinyl in the tri-fold cover that includes the bonus tracks on the final side.  It actually sounds pretty damn good for a pirate pressing.  Best sounding LP of the lot is probably the Slint record, which is dead silent, which helps when cranking the silent passages.  I still have plenty more albums on my want list, but feel like I have a decent start towards a nice collection for the decade.](https://preview.redd.it/01ao8gbmh4t81.jpg?width=3397&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc16a8cf29f571b3994f32008de7da2c6c4d5baf)",0,1649780548

Ice Cube method seemed to do a little bit of help and a couple good cleanings have also done some good but the clicks remain. I'd say about 2-3 tracks are pretty ""annoying"" to listen to but a good 5-6 are pretty tight. 

I guess my question is would any of you guys even bother keeping an album in this shape? Am i doing more harm to my system than good listening to it? I have some other records in this sort of shape from thrifting but I'm getting to the point where I'm not sure it's even worth keeping them. Thoughts? Keep if for art? Send it back to the thrift? Should I give the ""toothpick"" method a go?",0,1649769786

Is it EVER okay to scratch vinyl?

Background: I launched a [podcast about music making](https://anchor.fm/thetuneshedpodcast) with my friend who is a pro. Next Sunday our episode on sampling vinyl comes out, and he suggested taking old records and just scratching them, changing speeds and all sorts of other shenanigans to get weird and fun sounds out. We made a really cool beat on air! But also, would real vinyl heads shun us? If not, do you just buy a cheap set up to do this kind of action?

I find that making records is quite possibly the biggest shit show I've ever been a part of. It's fun. I enjoy it, maybe even love it. Many of my coworkers do not. It's a lonely gig sometimes at the places I've worked at. The company I work for now is brand new and very dysfunctional but it is nice to be able to have all this extra experience that no one else has .

The other night a friend and I had a big night and ended up passing out with a record spinning. I didn‚Äôt realise until I got home from work 48 hours later that my turntable had been going the whole time. Now there‚Äôs a little groove in the runout of my (brand new!) Mos Def record and I‚Äôm worried about what condition my stylus might be in!
