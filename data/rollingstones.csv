rollingstones,ulqqdu,TheDrRudi,1,"‚ÄòPeople took so many drugs, they forgot they played on it‚Äô ‚Äì stars on Exile on Main St, the Rolling Stones‚Äô sprawling masterpiece ‚Ä¶","Recorded during several hedonistic months in a fabulous C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur villa, Exile on Main St is seen as the Stones‚Äô epic, creative peak. As the classic album turns 50, stars tell us how it got their rocks off.

In 1971, facing tax problems and an uncertain future, the Rolling Stones decamped to Villa Nellc√¥te on the C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur, where they partied with various celebrities, musicians, girlfriends, wives, kids, animals, drug-dealers and hangers-on for several hedonistic months. Recording in the damp, labyrinthine basement with a mobile studio parked outside and musicians seemingly turning up at random, they somehow produced Exile on Main St, a rough-hewn, sprawling, eclectic, 18-song double album that is widely regarded as their creative peak. Here, as it turns 50, stars salute its enduring greatness.

rollingstones,ua9f1y,Rick-D-99,1,The soundtrack to my awakening.,"The Rolling Stones have always been my favorite band, but I'd never been one to seek out albums or do the full 'fan education'. I just knew that, to me they sound like a summer day with the windows open and the feeling of life in your lungs.

It shouldn't have been, but was, a surprise that their music would be the soundtrack to one of the most profound experiences that a human being is capable of experiencing.

One night when I was feeling especially contemplative, I was sitting alone in my apartment after a couple months after a bad breakup. I was feeling incredibly grateful for existence, for the intricacy of the ups and downs: how bad experiences lead to growth, and growth leads to good experiences. I was listening to Debussy's Clair de Lune and crying a lot at this feeling of gratitude a lot at this time of my life.

Fast forward to about 12:30am and I hear a bunch of noise outside my door. It's the drunken stumblings in of my neighbor/friend who worked at a bar and partied a lot. He was a young guy, very nice but rowdy. Anyway, as they passed I swung the door open and surprised them. He was kind of shocked by the surprise and immediately became apologetic about the noise they were making. My reply was, ""no, man, I'm stoked to see you!""

They invited me over to hang out. I'm in my mid-30s so college kid hanging out isn't super my thing, but I was feeling especially effusive that night and was just marvelling at every element of existence; each person being such an amazing existence that really could have just been blank/nothing/void forever.

In any case, we were all really in to good music, so I started doing this thing that I sometimes do when I'm in a group of people where I ask them what song they want to hear. It's a common question, so I go in to detail about my question, which is that I don't want them to tell me what song is popular, or they think people will like... What I want is for them to reach in and find something, no matter how weird, that will bring them joy to hear. The point of this exercise is that after about the second or third person's selection, people start catching on that we're feeling joy for this person's enjoyment of the song.

By the time it was the last person's choice of the last of three rounds of this, they picked Sweet Virginia, which is a great song. I've heard it a lot and love it. After that we let the music go on auto and it started making choices based on Sweet Virginia.

Anyways, 20 minutes later while everyone was happy, dancing, hanging out and talking, a song I'd never heard before came on. The first sound was that summer day feeling I described at the beginning, an echoey guitar interrupted by the ringing out of a piano chord and Mick.

""Saw you stretched out

In room ten o' nine

With a smile on your face, and a tear right in your eye""


I'd never heard this song before, but I knew the sound. As the subtle little guitar scale run led towards the chorus my entire world began to shift rapidly, very rapidly. In the instant between kieth's guitar riff and the first words of the chorus I realized a great truth about this life, and what it is. Some call this awakening, some call it the mystical experience, some reference enlightenment... What it was to me was being itself introducing its true face to me, its thankful and loving child, and along with this blessing the gift of what would become familiar to my family as my ""funeral song"".

The experience surpassed any concept of bliss that I could have guessed at before. It's as if, in an instant, all concern about death, about despair, about pain, about anything left me and was replaced by the deepest peace one can comprehend; peace as loving and deep and space is dark and infinite. One taste of this is enough to eradicate all disdain for any and all living beings. One sip of this view of reality is enough to eradicate every opinion one has ever held on to, and will teach you that you know nothing about what you thought was solid ground. It's enough to show you what ""you"" are, and are not.

I really enjoyed the hell out of Exile on Main St. Fantastic album, and I‚Äôm starting to think that was part of the finest run of albums from late 60s into the 70s. Such a great time, and I felt really engaged throughout.

This is what I have always imagined rock to sound like and my deep listening of the band‚Äôs discography is making me realize a lot of why they‚Äôre going for so long. Comforting, grooving, just memorable and pretty sort of music with showmanship I can‚Äôt even imagine in a live setting.

There‚Äôs such a great laid back feeling to this track, like there was room left for each part to shine perfectly. The brass comes in just at the right time, and I love Keith‚Äôs guitar in this. The keyboards BEAUTIFULLY play in a kind of subdued way at first, with the right power coming in when needed, and of course Charlie being able to drop in and out was just the icing on the cake.

Can definitely hear gospel influence here, and I‚Äôm happy to see that style flow into the band‚Äôs sound.",0,1649119002

Got the lucky dip tickets but still unsure how all of it works. I understand the part that I'll get 2 random tickets but the part that bothers me is the fact that I'll be able to pick up the tickets only 1 hour before the show starts. I suppose the lines will be huge and I'm a little bit worried if I'm gonna make it on time to get the tickets and find my seats. It says that the tickets will be scattered around the whole stadium at several counters. What if I go to one counter, spend 30-40 minutes waiting in line, and get the tickets for the seats that are on the completely opposite side of the stadium? San Siro ain't small and it'll probably take eternity to get from one side to the other while moving through the crowd.

Hope someone can explain a bit more about how the whole thing works and whether I should be worried about anything or I'm just panicking for no reason rn. :D",0,1647690583
rollingstones,thma5j,Beatlemaniac__,1,Contradicting opinions on Brian Jones,"I‚Äôve been doing a lot of reading about Brian Jones recently and I find it really interesting how different everyone‚Äôs opinions on him are. Mick and Keith don‚Äôt ever seem to have anything good to say about him, Charlie was split in the middle and Bill is the only one who seems to say consistently nice things about him. Mick and Keith claim that Brian totally overdid drugs and alcohol and that‚Äôs what eventually led to his death, while Bill (who often shared hotel rooms with Brian) maintains that aside from alcohol, the only things Brian ever took frequently, was painkillers and sleeping pills. Although there‚Äôs likely some truth to the claim that Brian too many drugs, I really don‚Äôt think Mick and Keith are very creditable because they were the ones who allegedly bullied Brian and generally tended to dislike him. Furthermore, Mick and Keith‚Äôs story about how Brian started to go into ‚Äúbye bye land‚Äù in 1967 really doesn‚Äôt seem to add up when you look at how many credits he has on Their satanic majesties request and beggars banquet. He plays on every single majesties track and plays 8/10 on beggars. Moving on to 1969, he has 3 performances on Let it bleed (autoharp on you got the silver, congas on midnight rambler and uncredited mellotron on let it bleed)  Considering there are only 9 songs on Let it bleed and Brian left before recording was even halfway over, 3 performances isn‚Äôt that bad! And although I can‚Äôt verify this, I‚Äôve also heard that he is on demos for honkey tonk women which was around this same period. Another thing that I think is really telling is that according to Bill, Brian also suffered from mood swings and I‚Äôve heard some people say he had a history with epilepsy too. This combined with his lack of interest in the band could have majorly contributed to his departure from the band rather then the commonly believed extreme drug problems story. I know this post is a grammatical nightmare and is also probably pointless, but the main thing I wanted to get at is that Bill‚Äôs stories of Brian majorly contradict Mick and Keith‚Äôs, which are generally taken as fact.",0,1647659542

Start Me Up is one of their best and most popular singles.

Hang Fire is their best doo-wop song.

Slave is one of their best groove oriented songs, and it's even got Sonny Rollins on it.

Little T&amp;A is one of the best Keith songs.

Black Limousine is a fantastic blues number.

Neighbours is their best punk inspired song.

Worried About You could be their best soul ballad.

Tops is just a great song overall, and the riff is awesome.

Heaven has one of the coolest and mood setting productions in their catalogue.

No Use In Crying is beautiful and soulful.

Waiting On A Friend is another classic with a beautiful melody.

rollingstones,t8bk64,Sighunt,1,Release ALL of the Rolling Stones Get Yer Ya Yas Out MSG '69 Recordings!," 

Hello. Long time Rolling Stones music fan, first time posting on this site. I along with many other Stones fans have long appreciated the 1969 American tour, including the in-concert Madison Square Garden recordings that became Get Yer Ya Yas Out! We feel that it is long overdue that Abkco/the Stones organization release ALL three of the MSG shows via a boxed set (along with any professional concert footage shot by the Maysles not included in Gimme Shelter edited for a COMPLETE concert to be included with this package). **An active petition went on-line a couple days ago**. Our goal is to acquire as many signatures as possible, and then we will forward this petition to Abkco and the Stones organization. All of us who were behind this petition feel that this would be a much sought after release, not just for hard core Stones fans, but for consumers who appreciate great quality music from the 1960's era. The site (on [change.org](https://change.org)) is easy to use and navigate and there are no mandatory fees required. We would greatly appreciate your signatures and any publicity and/or support you can offer to make this audio/video box set a reality. Please tell any interested Stones fans you know about this petition! Thank you for reading this and supporting our efforts.

Below is the link for the petition:

rollingstones,swpw4a,Ogrochogro333,1,Glorification of Mick Taylor and Brian Jones,"It‚Äôs funny how every now and then people compare ‚ÄúMick Taylor period‚Äù versus ‚ÄúRonnie Wood period‚Äù, or ‚ÄúBrian Jones period‚Äù as if any of them were major catalysts. Taylor contributed to some of the songs here and there, as well as Wood and Brian Jones was a multi-instrumentalist and some of the songs(not many, but still) wouldn‚Äôt exist without him, so there are points to be made, but all in all, 95% of the songs are Jagger/Richards. So, what are people comparing? Who can play the guitar parts better? I‚Äôm sure anyone above could play each other‚Äôs parts very efficiently, there are hundreds of excellent guitar players and I‚Äôve seen random players who could mimic Mick Taylor note-for-note. I see people arguing about the most pointless technicalities. Do you really think Mick Taylor is the only person in the world who can play slide guitar on Love in Vain? I can assure you that there are plenty of excellent guitarists out there. And there are also many people who can play the same instruments that Brian Jones played, but better. One thing I can tell you though for sure is that nobody can sing like Jagger and nobody can write songs like Jagger/Richards. Everything else is replaceable, including Charlie Watts, as good of a drummer as he was, God rest his soul. Basically Jagger/Richards was and is The Rolling Stones.",18,1645322300

rollingstones,svap6y,DanaAndrews,1,The Stones NEEDED Mick Taylor; Ron Wood NEEDED The Stones,"I'd say that's the biggest difference between the two. 

When Mick Taylor joined The Stones were in a whole new ball game. The Guitar God era, and Keith, who had been doing the lead solos (except for Jones's slide)... his style was dated and though he had tremendous feeling, they needed an ace, a shredder, a God of their own, and they got it...

Once Taylor left and Wood joined, the Guitar God era was done. Jimi was dead, Clapton went country, and The Stones became more R&amp;B/Rock and Wood became a secondary guitar for Keith... Keith who, I betcha, swore to NEVER be outshined by another phenom...

Wood provided Richards no competition and the sound again revolved around Keith's Chuck Berryesque riffs, and a few notes from Ronnie. Their two great albums with Wood were Some Girls and Tattoo, and the latter had Taylor and Wayne Perkins, so...

If you think that Taylor was on FOUR records and compare that to Wood, just count Taylor's albums... you all know them... now count the first four Wood records... It ends with their last attempt to be relevant, Undercover, leading to a collection of albums that played it safe with hit-or-miss tracks that never seemed like they connect as a whole...",4,1645164403

rollingstones,su363v,Ogrochogro333,1,Sticky Fingers is overrated. Ranks below every album up until their 1989-2005 period.,"People often dismiss their 80‚Äôs and middle 70‚Äôs, but up until their so called ‚Äúcomeback‚Äù with overproduced lazy ‚ÄúSteel Wheels‚Äù, Stones didn‚Äôt have a weak album. It was always the quintessential ‚ÄúStones‚Äù sound no matter which genre they dabbled in; I think their smaller scale albums like Emotional rescue, its only rock n roll, black and blue, undercover really underscore the essence of the band - that they could just knock out rock n roll numbers, quality fillers at their own whim, or at least it feels like it. Everyone knows their hits, but besides those hugely successful albums, this is basically archetypical Stones. Certainly more ‚ÄúStones‚Äù than ‚ÄúSticky Fingers‚Äù. Mick Taylor/Jagger had more to do with this album than Keith and it shows. Moonlight mile, Sister morphine, sway, u gotta move are all nonsense to me. All of these are Jagger/Taylor, and well ‚Äúu gotta move‚Äù is just a filler. Not saying Sticky Fingers is bad, but it is certainly not a Number 1 - it‚Äôs not even top 10 for me personally. It‚Äôs beyond me why it‚Äôs considered better than masterpiece like Let it bleed.",25,1645037283

Our thought is maybe it was an intro just on the album and that's why we can't find it by playing various songs on YouTube.

rollingstones,sce3v1,xs_noize,1,KEITH RICHARDS announces boxset of acclaimed album 'Main Offender' &amp; reveals previously-unreleased version of ‚ÄòHow I Wish (Live)‚Äô,"**Keith Richards releases a limited edition super-deluxe boxset of his acclaimed, second solo album Main Offender, on March 18th via BMG, featuring a host of previously unreleased gems from the ‚ÄòWinos Live In London ‚Äò92‚Äô performance recorded at the Town &amp; Country Club, Kentish Town.**

This collection also includes an 88-page book with never-before-seen photos, reproductions of handwritten lyrics, reprinted essays from the album‚Äôs release, and more, plus an archival envelope containing exact replicas of promotional and tour materials from Keith‚Äôs archive.

Main Offender is the latest treasure trove of Keith Richards material to be released and follows last year‚Äôs Live At The Hollywood Palladium and the 2019 unveiling of his now legendary, first solo album Talk Is Cheap.

The album was originally released in October 1992, four years after Talk Is Cheap and features the much-loved X-Pensive Winos: drummer and long-time collaborator Steve Jordan (who recently drummed with the Rolling Stones on their 2021 No Filter Tour of the US), guitarist Waddy Wachtel, bassist Charley Drayton, keyboard player Ivan Neville, singer Sarah Dash and backing vocalist‚Äôs Bernard Fowler and Babi Floyd.

The captivating 10-tracks on Main Offender include the electric singles ‚ÄòWicked As It Seems‚Äô, ‚ÄòEileen‚Äô and ‚ÄòHate It When You Leave‚Äô. The album was produced by Keith Richards, Waddy Wachtel and Steve Jordan. The bonus live album was mixed and produced by Jordan as well.

Keith says:

*‚ÄúThis is the second time around &amp; the Winos are kind of developing‚Äîand if I can keep those guys together for as long as I can, it‚Äôs one of the best bands in the world. It‚Äôs a very intriguing band and the potential is only just starting to show itself.*

*If I hadn‚Äôt have taken the Winos on the road, this record would probably have been totally different than it is.*

*I tried to avoid making too much sense on this record because to me that ambiguity and mystery, and a little provocation to make you think, is something far more powerful and more important than just wagging your finger and saying, ‚ÄòI know what he‚Äôs saying don‚Äôt do this, do that.‚Äô If you‚Äôre a musician, silence is your canvas and you never want to fill-in the whole thing because then you‚Äôve just covered it all‚Ä¶*

*One of the most interesting parts about music is where you don‚Äôt play.‚Äù*

rollingstones,rs107w,manwhofelltoearth76,1,Listened to Sticky Fingers (and The Rolling Stones) for the first time!,"So I'm new to music and I posted in r/rock asking for an introduction to rock music. One of the replies pointed me to Sticky Fingers by The Rolling Stones. I thought I'd give it a listen since I knew the lips and tongue logo was representative of the band and was everywhere (stickers, pins, posters, wallpapers and shirts), plus it was released 50 years ago so I thought that was a nice little thing.

Anyway, I purchased Spotify premium and decided to listen to the original album whilst reading about it on the band's website and honestly I must say... I am very, very impressed with this music. All the members and guest musicians seem incredibly talented and it is very clear that they have a passion for music. I'm excited to hear more of The Rolling Stones but don't know where to start given that they have such an expansive discography!

As I listened I found myself more and more comfortable in the album, all throughout each song was special. I personally liked the songs 'Brown Sugar'  and 'Sister Morphine' the most. I really enjoyed the guitar too, the lead. I think it's Mick Taylor? He seems like an incredible musician, lots of feeling. I kept in mind the idea that this album was ""a magic formula of heavy soul, junkie blues and macho rock"" and it delivered exactly just that.

Given that this is only my second album I've ever listened to (after Is This It by The Strokes), I've got to say it's definitely something I'll hold close to my heart, forever. A perfect 10/10",0,1640868424

There aren't many singles before that contain a harpsichord in that fashion. According to Wikipedia, She's Not There by The Zombies is the first baroque pop song in 1964. While The Zombies would go on to do baroque pop later in their career, I would argue their earlier output was more influenced by jazz and soul. Play With Fire was released before The Beach Boys and The Beatles would go on to use the instrument fairly often in the mid 60s.",0,1639298137

rollingstones,rdti0h,Stat64,1,Why does Keith Richards play bass on many essential Rolling Stones songs?,"The bass player for The Rolling Stones is widely known to be Bill Wyman. However, on their album *Beggars Banquet*, guitarist Keith Richards plays bass on ""Sympathy for the Devil"", ""Street Fighting Man"", and ""Stray Cat Blues""; as well as on their single ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"", recorded during the same sessions. Bill Wyman isn't credited on ""Street Fighting"" and ""Stray Cat"", but is credited on ""Sympathy"" (shekere) and ""Jumpin' Jack"" (organ). 

Keith has played bass on albums before *Beggars*, such as *Aftermath* (""Under My Thumb"", ""Flight 505"", ""It's Not Easy""), *Between the Buttons* (""Yesterday's Papers"", ""Let's Spend the Night Together"", ""Connection"",  ""She Smiled Sweetly""), and *Their Satanic Majesties Request* (""2000 Light Years from Home""). For most of these songs, he is credited as ""fuzz bass"" while Bill is still credited for bass. This possibly means Keith added his ""fuzz bass"" parts during overdub sessions. The only exception to this is ""Let's Spend the Night Together"", which doesn't credit Bill at all.

Keith also plays bass on following albums, like *Let It Bleed* (""Live With Me""), *Exile on Main St.* (""Casino Boogie"", ""Happy"", ""Soul Survivor""), and most of *Goats Head Soup*. He doesn't play any bass on *Sticky Fingers*, making it the only album from this time where Bill is credited for all bass parts. It's worth noting guitarist Mick Taylor plays bass on a handful of songs on *Exile*.

Knowing all of this makes me ask ""Why does Keith play bass on these songs?"" This is especially the case for *Beggars*, as he is credited on ""Sympathy"" and ""Jumpin' Jack"" for different instruments. Did Bill just decide to not play bass for these songs? I understand for ""Street Fighting"" and ""Stray Cat"", he was most likely not present for those particular sessions. He wouldn't be very present for *Exile*'s recording sessions, and especially not for the recording sessions of *Goats.* But for *Beggars* and everything before that, why does Keith play bass for these songs mentioned?

P.S. I do think Keith's bass lines for these songs are great, especially for ""Jumpin' Jack Flash."" His bass playing is very similar to his guitar playing, as it's very loose and not on-beat; but has a lot of character to it. I find it interesting that he played bass during this time so much, that he decided to be the bass player in the one-time supergroup The Dirty Mac for *The Rock and Roll Circus* in December 1968*.*",15,1639203839

So I‚Äôm not hating I just honestly was curious about your alls opinions. I didn‚Äôt grow up in those days so I have a very dim point of view. Plus I‚Äôm just getting into the stones so I need some guidance on the subject.

I‚Äôm told he did a lot of good experimentation with instruments. And I‚Äôm also guessing he was the lead guitarist? Did he write most of their early stuff after they got past the covers?

rollingstones,r7yb3s,xs_noize,1,ANDREA CORR &amp; RONNIE WOOD release rendition of Elvis Presley's 'Blue Christmas',"**Andrea Corr of Irish band The Corrs and Ronnie Wood of the Rolling Stones have teamed up to release a delightful seasonal duet of Elvis Presley‚Äôs ‚ÄòBlue Christmas‚Äô out now on east-west.**¬†

The pair have been ‚Äòsoul mates‚Äô since The Corrs toured with the Stones in the late 1990s. So, it was no surprise that Ronnie said yes when Andrea asked him to play guitar and duet with her on this Elvis classic.

Their playful version of Blue Christmas is rooted in the Elvis Presley recording, with the voices of The Corr‚Äôs lead singer and the Rolling Stone guitarist offering a fresh, new take on this much-loved song.

*‚ÄúThe bluesy guitar on the Elvis original immediately brought Ronnie to mind‚Äù* says Andrea Corr. *‚ÄúI thought, maybe he‚Äôll sing with me too. I gave him all the outs: I‚Äôll understand, not to worry, we can still be friends and he just said, ‚Äòyeah‚Äô with so much enthusiasm. Now it‚Äôs not just him and his guitar that I love, his singing is so good on this record.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúAs soon as Andrea asked and I listened to her voice on Blue Christmas I knew I wanted in, I didn‚Äôt even have to think about it‚Äù* said Ronnie Wood, who has just finished an American Rolling Stones tour. *‚ÄúWe had great fun doing it.‚Äù*

rollingstones,r5bbl8,leafy_returns,1,Question,"As someone who‚Äôs just recently fell in love with the stones music i have a couple questions regarding guitar duties for the band for you guys. Also would love to spark a conversation about the Stones so stick around and read this brief convo and let me pick your brains, since you‚Äôre my new family as I‚Äôm a fan for life no doubt!! I‚Äôm quite new and don‚Äôt know squat about them and I‚Äôd love to learn a lot.

They‚Äôre super talented and interesting to me but I know very little. Give me as much details or little tidbits of info you may know about the band I‚Äôd really love to pick your guy‚Äôs or gals brains those of you who‚Äôve been fans for a while, or even if you‚Äôre a new fan like me, let‚Äôs hear it.

Question 1. Who was the guitarist(s) for each album? I believe it was first Brian Jones era, then Mick Taylor, then only Keith briefly maybe? And then Wood. But I‚Äôd like to know about each album who it was on guitars. Like what albums were Brian Jones, which were MT albums, and then all the Wood albums?

Also which is your favorite guitarist/era and why? I personally really enjoy the hell out of the guitars on Let it Bleed and Sticky Fingers which I believe are both Mick Taylor albums so he may be my current favorite, and I wish he had stayed longer. His personality is a big negative to me the few live pieces/videos of him I‚Äôve seen he‚Äôs way too shy and quiet when Jagger and Richards have great stage spark. So talent wise it‚Äôs definitely Mick for me. soul/stage performance or whatever you call it it‚Äôs Ronnie Wood. He just looks as if he fits in with them so much more and just pumps me up with his hyped up attitude it‚Äôs a nice difference maker, he just looks like he fits in more than Taylor maybe that‚Äôs why Taylor left he just didn‚Äôt fit in personality wise.

The weird thing too is that when anyone else would play bass it would be very upfront in the mix (keith, mick taylor, and woody). When wyman played live his bass would be quite loud too and from some girls on his bass on albums was very loud such as ‚Äústart me up‚Äù.

rollingstones,qyir3u,Hani713,1,Is there any band greater than the Stones?!,"The Stones are amazing! When you truly take the time to listen, you just can't help but realize how amazing these guys really are! It's so impressive seeing how many phases and changes they've gone through. I've seen many bands go through changes but the Stones did it all while staying super relevant. 
Their music has spanned generations and stood the test of time!
Throughout the sixties they were big with hits such as satisfaction and albums such as Let it Bleed and Beggars Banquet. So many classic songs in the first decade alone!

Then going into the 70s you have Sticky fingers and Exile which are still highly regarded today! Some of their best and well known songs.

Then in the late seventies when we thought the Stones were running low on steam going into middle age they come out with their best selling album of all time...Some girls! Not everyone likes the big hit which was Miss you but I actually like it and think it's a very Stones-esque take on Disco. It doesn't matter what genre they do, I just love the end result.

They quickly follow it up with emotional rescue 
And become relevant once again into the 80s with Tattoo you and hits like Start me up. All while touring heavily all over the world and selling out shows.

Not everyone is a big fan of their nineties stuff (I am since I'm just a Stones nut) but you can't deny they had TWO of the highest grossing tours of the 1990s (Voodoo lounge and Steel Wheels)
#1 and #2 respectively. Even if you don't like their music you gotta give the guys credit for staying relevant for over four decades. Even into the 2000s and 00s they're still doing huge stadium tours heck they're currently packing up stadiums still doing their No filter tour.


Can anyone really name a greater band???!",55,1637454427

I have one or maybe two PIT tickets to The Rolling Stones concert in Detroit on Monday, Nov 15 at Ford Field. These tickets include the pre-show hospitality passes which includes an open bar and snacks. Might see a celebrity or two in the hospitality lounge, too as I've seen before! 

PIT tickets allow fans to get up close and personal and watch the show from the best views in the venue (literally next to the stage). You'll experience the pulse-pounding music of The Rolling Stones in one of the closest areas to the stage! One ticket alone for this experience starts at $500. I'm offering the ticket and the hospitality lounge for $550. 

Why I might have one or two: 
This is a last minute trip that some of my friends might not be able to make it to. I definitely have one of these experiences available and I'm selling for $550. I'll know in the next day or so if I have two tickets, maybe even three! If you're one buyer who would purchase both, I'll sell them both $900. 

The tickets are physical so we'd have to meet up in person to make the exchange. It's probably the safest way to do this, anyhow.

rollingstones,qp1q0x,CloseUrMouthCuntface,1,Went to the Vegas show last night and frankly it was underwhelming,"I‚Äôm not a die hard fan of the stones but I do enjoy most of their catalog. With covid and the older bands eventually on their way out I wanted to check them off my list and frankly the show was okay. 

Their energy was good, the geriatric crowd was at a lull for most of the set. The first song (street fighting man) was terrible and now that I had time to digest they needed a song or two to get warmed up because the rest of the show was enjoyable but just not something I would see again. 

Not trying to diminish others enjoyment of the show, just giving my opinion. I‚Äôve seen Paul McCartney and billy Joel within a couple of years ago (they‚Äôre both almost as old as the stones) and they were really great and I guess I was thinking it would be different with the stones.

rollingstones,qn6dvh,Stat64,1,Is Beggars Banquet one of the first political albums in pop music?,"For 1968, Beggars Banquet is a pretty political and socially aware album. The most obvious example is the single Street Fighting Man, but there's other examples. Examples include: Sympathy for the Devil mentioning the assassinations of the Kennedys, Jigsaw Puzzle having the line ""The queen is bravely shouting 'What the hell is going on?'"", and Salt of the Earth being about the working class and ""stay at home voters."" Not every song on the album is as socially aware, but it is a theme throughout Beggars Banquet. 

Compared this to many other pop albums of the time, Beggars Banquet was much more socially and political conscious. There were other political focused popular artists at this time, such as Bob Dylan and James Brown. However, The Rolling Stones with Beggars Banquet was along side those artists when making serious statements of the political world. This would lead the way for more politically aware popular music in the late 60s and early 70s. 

Beggars Banquet should be more respected in this light. It was an album that mentioned current issues going on while also going on to be a commercial success, showing that both could be done.",16,1636100203

I understand that this is basically Keith noting his WEAVING GUITAR thing but...

I have a problem with it because Ron Wood joined the band relatively late... By the time Wood came on board, The Stones had already done enough to where they were set for a lifetime of concerts and classic songs to choose from (I'm NOT saying Some Girls and Tattoo aren't great, but after that, that was it)...

So if Keith is saying that from 1962 to 1975 he was a crummy guitarist because he hadn't found Ron Wood, well...

I have  a problem with that because The Stones's best work was from 1968 to 1974...

I think that Keith may be saying the same thing about ALL the co-guitarits, but at the same time, MICK TAYLOR was an extremely talented guitarist on his own, as was Brian Jones...

I think Keith said this not for himself but for Ron Wood, because Wood does need Keith... Wood's live performances have been very lazy; he hasn't turned in a great live solo since 1978 so...

Perhaps Keith was making up for Ron Wood with that quote...

2. The Beatles- Day Tripper: written as a response to the success of satisfaction.

3. Kiss- I Was Made for Loving You: after the huge success of the stones disco inflected hit ‚ÄúMiss You‚Äù many rock bands started working disco into their songs, they came up with this song.

4. The Saints- Messin With the Kid: if anyone wants to hear the Stones influence on Punk Rock, listen to this tune. Basically a reworking of ‚ÄúSway‚Äù.

5. The Who- A Legal Matter: though they don‚Äôt sound as similar as others on the list, the riff and chorus of this song were written with the stones ‚ÄúThe Last Time‚Äù in mind.",8,1635735156

This of course goes to backup Keith's ""Guitar Weaving"" invention 

The thing is: the weaving has been going on for much longer than Ron Wood's been with the band

Brian Jones and especially MICK TAYLOR  were in fact VERY GREAT guitar players with or without Keith Richards; although let it be said Taylor's greatest work of course was with The Stones, and Brian died too early to prove otherwise (although songs like Mona prove how great he is alone)

But I think what Keith was saying was, basically:

""Since Ron Wood retired after 1978 and hasn't tried to provide any decent guitar-work in live performances, he's only good with me""

To where, for that I totally agree

But I still think that KEITH is great with or without Ronnie",14,1635702436

I'm doing a fictional podcast about a Swedish cop that attends the Altamont Free Concert that the documentary Gimme Shelter (1970) is about. It's a very good time travel to 1969 and the chaos that happened during the concert, also the bands reaction to the footage.

I just wonder if there are any interviews out there where any band members talk about it. Both old and newer interviews are interesting.

Have a good weekend everyone!",5,1635639168

Fool to Cry and Memory Motel are incredible ballads and Hot Stuff and Hand of Fate are really cool too. On Steel Wheels, Mixed Emotions and Continental Drift are really good and there are a lot of cool songs like Rock and a Hard Place, Sad Sad Sad, Terrifying, Almost Hear You Sigh and Slipping Away (I even really liked Keith‚Äòs Can‚Äôt Be Seen).

rollingstones,qimd2o,Obvious_Experience52,1,My Stones story (or basically how I learned to appreciate classic rock),"First off, I'd like to preface this by saying I was too young to be part of the British invasion of the '60s (I was born near the end of '72). When I was growing up I had several bad influences regarding older music in my life. My dad was a racist curmudgeon who listened to mostly '60s folk, but longed for the world of the '40s, and openly hated almost everything made after that. If he paid you a compliment, make sure you record it because it doesn't happen often.   


My stepdad, on the other hand, loved basically anything the oldies station would put out and this guy was a fine specimen of humanity (sarcasm meter about to explode). He smoked 3 packs of cigarettes a day, drank until he was so drunk that even standing up was a problem for him, watched porn and had some of the sleaziest, most degrading stuff you could imagine and his attitude was extremely racist and misogynistic. He would often say things like ""You should listen to good stuff like Simon and Garfunkel"" or stuff like that. If it happened after the '60s, he wanted no part in it.   


The one person I never asked her opinion of the Stones on was my Mom. My mom was a little bit cooler, she would listen to almost anything except profane rap and screamo heavy metal. I eventually got her into acts like Divine Ascension, Mindmaze, Disturbed and Lacuna Coil. She was way more open-minded than most people I knew but I never really sat down and asked her if she liked the Stones. I knew her favorite band was Queen and the Beatles were probably in her top 10 even though she only ever sang ""Here Comes The Sun"".   


My oldest brother was stuck in the '70s, and he was much of the same except I never saw him drink. But he always acted like a major manchild and often would do things that were stupid for the sake of being stupid. He would openly be verbally abusive towards me for listening to anything current, saying ""Well, this is just garbage"".   


My second and third brothers combined completely ruined the Beatles for me. I probably would have not been a big fan of them anyways, but my second brother married a woman who would look for an excuse to gaslight me and my last brother would quote Chevy Chase way too much (and would beat a joke into the ground), to a point where I openly stipulated to him that requests for ""hot fat, heads of dictators or Beatles albums would be cheerfully ignored"". Once I mentioned the Beatles, Marie would rip me a new ass ""Don't be talking crap about the Beatles"".   


Anyways, in 1989 the Stones had released Steel Wheels and had opened a tour. I was disinterested because I knew they were big before I was born and 16-year old me foolishly thought that meant it wasn't made for me since I wasn't around when it was made. Plus my influences didn't help much. In fact, the only song I was truly familiar with was Start Me Up which was okay, but not a great song. I even called them the ""Rocks"" instead of the Stones.   


Not much changed in the '90s or early 2000s except my stepdad and my oldest brother were both out of my life. I honestly couldn't have cared less, but their condescending attitude stuck with me, in fact, to be honest, the first time I really enjoyed a Stones song was when Paint it Black came on Guitar Hero in 2007.   


Anyways, years went on and I had heard a few songs but other than Sympathy for the Devil and Gimme Shelter, I couldn't name any other songs to save my ass. When Charlie Watts died, I even told a friend of mine the only reason I didn't get to see the Stones was because any half-decent seats had a comma in the price tag.   


But then I got to thinking two things. One, I started my concert going in 2010 when my musical idol, Ronnie James Dio passed away and I never got to see him and that affected me, and two, who in the world would have been more influential than a band from the British invasion that somehow has survived all this time? What would I say if the band went away and I never got to see them, especially with them being around almost six freakin' decades?   


So I went looking for a ticket with a cap of $130. I didn't quite make it (the ticket was $138) but I wavered and bought it. That's when I came here and asked for songs. Even without Charlie, I gotta admit they knew how to put on a show, and now I can honestly say I saw The Rolling Stones before they went away, which is bound to happen sometime. (I jokingly said ""The Rolling Stones Tour 2035, this is the last Keith Riff, we promise!"") but who would have thought in the '60s, '70s, or '80s they'd still be touring in 2021?    


Anyways, I changed my assessment and am now a fan. If I had been alive in the '60s, I would have probably been a Stones or a Who fan (probably way more than the Beatles, especially since I'm not a huge Merseybeat fan) and even though I probably won't see them again (hey, $138 for a nosebleed seat is not something I can do too often) but I think now I have a lot more respect for this band and their offerings. They may even end up in my top 30 bands someday which is dominated right now by a KICK-ASS all girl metal scene coming out of Japan.   


The next old school band I will probably try to see will either be the Eagles or Foreigner, I'm really more familiar  with their work and I would probably enjoy seeing them once if I can find a decently priced ticket.   


So here's to the Stones and the 380 other bands I've seen live or over livestream, most of which were probably influenced in some way, shape and form by them. I had bad role models and I was wrong about saying they weren't for me. You may hate me for coming late to the party but at least I showed up.",0,1635541471

Might As Well Get Juiced is one of the weirdest songs they ever did but I think that's what makes it a great and memorable track. It also has three amazing Keith songs - You Don't Have to Mean It, Thief in the Night, and How Can I Stop. 

It doesn't live up to their 70s period at all (except maybe Black and Blue, I prefer BTB over that) but I prefer it over most of their 80s and some of their 60s albums.",14,1635009074

Meanwhile for HOT STUFF Harve Mandel provided a kind of jazz fusion thing, which Taylor was also good at...

They knew Ron Wood could never, ever pull off such solos, making BB the last album with incredible top-of-the-line leads (except Tattoo You)... 

The Ron Wood tunes like Hey Negrita meanwhile showcase where The Stones were heading: Since the ""guitar god"" era was pretty much over, with Hendrix dead, Clapton into country, etc., The Stones became more grungy (for lack of a better term) and intentionally messy hard rock sound, which they hold to this day...

Nothing noted in the purchase process about limited view seating, if I look at the tickets on the desktop website there's nothing of note. I can even grab more nearby tickets on the mobile app and there is no indication that they are limited view seats. But if I look in the mobile app at the tickets purchased they are marked as ""Limited View"". Does anyone know the level of obstruction I should expect?

I was prepped and ready to purchase the cheapest tickets for the upcoming Hard Rock Hotel performance in Hollywood, FL. Opened the browser two hours before sale time, hit the Join Que button as soon as I was able to. And with all this prep there were still 2,000+ people in front of me. 

Once I finally get into the page to buy tickets, there is not a single ticket for the advertised price of $256 or whatever it was. Just $400+ and up, even the last seat at the very last row. These were not Platinum seats. But every single seat was $500 or more with fees.

The music was great and they played Ruby Tuesday. The  experience was not.  
 

I went into the venue with my brother when the gates opened and went to get our spots on the rail. Then it all  went downhill from there. Some a-hole came along 20 minutes later pushing and  shoving me claiming it‚Äôs his spot. We argue and he continues to push  while venue security looks the other way and ignores the escalating  situation. A-hole moves down a few spots. Then it comes out he‚Äôs selling  his spot for some 80 year old lady who is supposedly a friend on the  band.  
 

He gets his venmo money and begins to walk away. Then the bands head of  security, a bald guy named Chris, goes over to him and they‚Äôre all  ‚Äúbuddy‚Äù. It turns out Chris was getting a cut as they talked about business  and Chris wanted the old lady to have my spot, even though she‚Äôs only 4  people away from me and also on a rail. He came over and began asking  me and a few other people if we could give up our spots and move around  for this 1 lady. Another fan asked, ‚Äúwhy are you moving people?‚Äù. Chris  immediately became hostile and specifically said, ‚ÄúI can remove you from  the venue. Is that what you want? I can do it‚Äù.  
 

Chris then turns to me and asks ‚Äúso?‚Äù At this point I realized he would likely throw me out if I didn‚Äôt comply so I said sure if I can get a  set list. He agreed and I never heard from him again as he ignored me  the rest of the night while this old lady took up BOTH our spots. We ended up  2nd row and dealing with a bunch of idiots cutting in front of me the  whole night.   
 

I know it‚Äôs a bunch of BS because none of the band ever acknowledged  this ‚Äúlady‚Äù who was supposedly a good friend of the band. And if she was really friends, she would‚Äôve been on the other side of the rail with  band friends+family and backstage. But she wasn't.

After paying $500 for the ticket and being treated like that as a fan, I have no intention of ever seeing them again. And it's sad because it was a first Rolling Stone concert for us and we love their music.",58,1634347245

Was this a jab at Paul for referring to the Stones as a 'blues cover band'?  Or was Paul meant to actually join them and it fell through for some logistical reason?  I was  a little confused by this.  Me and several friends who went were thinking Paul was going to actually show up.

rollingstones,q58jo6,12frets,1,Nashville 10/9/21,"1. The Charlie video tribute kicks off the show. 
2. Best song of the night - and it‚Äôs not even a personal favorite - was 19th Nervous Breakdown. Punky, fast, sarcastic. It sounded GREAT. 
3. The sound quality was INCREDIBLE. Best of any stadium show I‚Äôve ever seen. 
4. The band sounded great. Tight, focused, energetic. 
5. The person who looked like they were having the most fun in the entire stadium? Steve Jordan. His drumming - and HUGE smile - was lovely. 
6. Keith dusted off Connection and Slippin‚Äô Away for his two songs. Connection sounded better during soundcheck. I think Keith went into a solo instead of the second verse mistakenly. There did seem a little confusion on stage. 
7. There was more interaction between Mick and Keith than I‚Äôve seen at any other Stones show I‚Äôve attended. Still not much, but during a snippet of Come On In My Kitchen within Midnight Rambler, they both looked at each other and broke into huge smiles. 
8. The band is now augmented by only two backup singers (Bernard Fowler and‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know her name) and two sax players (as well as keyboardists Chuck Leavell and Matt Clifford). The bridge on Gimme Shelter was good, but some sound quality issues/static when she‚Äôd hit the high notes for ‚ÄúMurder‚Äù. 
9. Ronnie had much, much more screen time than Keith on the ‚ÄúJumbotron‚Äù. 
10. Daryl Jones has a featured solo during Miss You. It‚Äôs fine, but seems weird since Keith and Ron only have solos within songs, not expanded. Kinda gratifying to see the Stones rhythm section in its current state: Daryl was handpicked by Charlie back in ‚Äò93, and Steve has been close to Keith since the 80s. 
11. If you get the chance? GO. It‚Äôs worth the money!!!
12. But!!! Don‚Äôt wait in line at the mercy stands. They ran out of the Nashville Tshirt by 4pm. I stood on line for half an hour to get SFA. (I did pick up a program. The photography is great,and it was made before Charlie pulled out/passed away, so lots of pics of him. (The foreword written by Anthony DeCurtis does address Charlie‚Äôs death)",21,1633874326

rollingstones,pzvwri,jedijj98,1,my journey,"I‚Äôm 39.  I‚Äôm a singer/musician. I‚Äôm a Stones fan.  Last year I did an experiment of listening to EVERY song on all of the top 500 albums of all time according to Rolling Stone magazine.  It‚Äôs not an easy venture. There was ALOT of music I didn‚Äôt like.  But I discovered so much and fell in love with so many new artists and bands and eras. 

I already started as an old soul with my love for classic rock and if you asked me beforehand, I would have said the Stones are definitely my favorite. After the experiment I really dove into the discogs of the Beatles (as a band and their solo careers).  I also listened in full to David Bowie, Led Zeppelin, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty &amp; the HB  

There‚Äôs so much great music to touch on and so many nuggets of new favorites, I could go on &amp; on. 

Here I am a year later, after all that musical discovery, nearly all I listen to is The Rolling Stones.  I find myself making specific playlists of favorite live tracks and acoustic tracks and lesser known songs. My wife got me the ‚ÄúMuddy Waters w/ The Rolling Stones‚Äù vynil for my birthday. I‚Äôm very excited for that Tattoo You edition coming out soon.  If I was a superfan before, I‚Äôm a superduperfan now.  I was at the St. Louis show and I have tickets to 3 more dates. I‚Äôm obsessed. 

I just wanted to share my experience.  I didn‚Äôt think I could become a bigger fan but it happened.  I guess it was worth while to get context.

rollingstones,pr1hyc,Youarethebigbang,1,"""New shit has come to light"". I was totally wrong on two ideas about the Stones U.S. tour this year","Was strongly against the tour, both when it was originally announced and after Charlie went back. I realize I was completely wrong, and I'm totally down with it now. 

Originally I objected mainly because we were in the middle of a pandemic and as a healthcare worker I was concerned about super spreader events and their proven burden on the healthcare system and risk to more vulnerable people's lives. Other bands were cancelling tours, rightfully so, and I felt like Mick was putt money (as if he needs any more) over American lives. Well, the pandemic is over, we've moved beyond it into the endemic stage, and it's simply not going to go away. We had solutions in this country and decided against all of them and to embrace the virus, and so now so am I. The fight is over. I've accepted the fact that everyone is going to contract the virus, myself included. My thought now is, what better place than a Stones concert to catch it. So fuck the virus, fuck masks, social distancing, fuck testing, fuck contact tracing, fuck vaccines, and whatever else would have ended it when we have the chance. It's too late, so it's time to enjoy life. 

As far as Charlie's death, I was 100 percent against any idea that there is a hand called The Rolling Stones without Charlie. Hell, we know there's no band without him. But fuck it. This short tour will just be a celebration of what was, and a final goodbye and thank you and tribute to Charlie and the boys. If they want it, they deserve it. We deserve it. Let's all go out with a bang. When it's done though, I'm done. If Mick tries to milk one more fucking album without Charlie, one more fucking tour, I'm simply gonna pretend it ain't happening. Enough is ebough, let it. 

I already said if the twins want to do music or concerts under a different name like Mick and Keefs Rolling Review or some cool, rock it out, I'm happy if they rock till their last breaths are gone. But again, no Charlie = no Stones. Mick said it before, Keith said it before, I've said it always.",3,1632026745

rollingstones,pqn7xh,Obvious_Experience52,1,song recommendations,"A little story about me. I grew up long after the Stones' heyday. In fact, probably the first time I really paid attention to them was when Start Me Up was playing, and that was a few years after the song was released.   


11 years ago, one of my musical idols passed away, Ronnie James Dio, and I vowed that day to spend at least ten years seeing all the old bands before they retired or died. For some reason the Stones just kept passing by and I didn't think about it. In fact, even with all the bands I have seen, I've seen only two that made music in the '60s (Deep Purple and The Beach Boys)   


Until now that is. 11 years and 377 bands later, I decided with Charlie Watts passing away and this band having been around nearly 60 years that I would go see them. The problem is other than the big radio hits (Sympathy for the Devil, Satisfaction, Paint It Black, Gimme Shelter, Beast of Burden and Start Me Up), I really haven't listened to a lot of this band.   


So I need something to prepare me for October 17 when I go to see them in Inglewood. Any ideas will be welcome. :)",9,1631974538

Recalling when the pair split he says, ""(John and I) had some funny times. We got really drunk and we went out on sailboats and we just sat around with guitars and played.

It must have been such an awesome moment for fans to hear Sympathy.  In my opinion, the first track and that album as a whole, is the big shift.  They finally found ‚Äútheir‚Äù sound.  It‚Äôs almost like they shed their earlier 60‚Äôs rock and blues, Chuck Berry - Muddy Waters influences and morphed into the greatest rock band of all time.  And then with Let it Bleed, they doubled down and got more experimental by doing straight up country songs.  I‚Äôm at the tale end of getting through the whole discography, and sure, there are some not so great 80‚Äôs albums, but I highly recommend doing the full discography.

rollingstones,pgm8bl,CharlesIntheWoods,1,Favorite expanded album reissue?,"With the expanded reissue of Tattoo You coming out I've been revisiting the expanded editions of albums they've re-released in the past couple years. It seems to be theme every three or four years they rerelease an album with an extra disk of 'outtakes' with new guitar and vocal overdubs. Interesting to see which album they give this treatment to next. Surprisingly many of these outtakes are actually pretty damn good!

If I had to choose a favorite, it would be 'Some Girls'. Even though Exile is my favorite album, Some Girls is my favorite package set with the strongest set of extra material. I also really enjoy how the bonus disk is all new songs, where I now view Some Girls as a double album, as opposed to other reissues which are filled with remixes and alternate takes of songs we've already heard hundreds of times. 

Interested to see what people's favorite reissues are and any albums you'd like to hear more from?

I'm in my mid-twenties and of all the 'classic oldies' bands that are still touring, the Stones are the only band I dream of seeing live. To me it's obvious the Stone's touring is about their love of playing live and not just about the money. If it was about the money, they would have stopped twenty years ago and had enough money to retire with great wealth for the rest of their lives. 

With Charlies passing, I have been wondering about the future of the band. Me personally, I hope for the band to continue recording and touring for as long as they can. While they may never record a 'classic' album again, I find a lot of joy in the Living In A Ghost Town song, and find it awesome that the boys continue to write and record good music. I find it oddly inspirational. 

I was wondering what people's thoughts are when it comes to the future of the band?",36,1630530908

The band seems real tight and the ""punk influence"" is clear.  Mick engaged in some of his funniest stage antics and I think is the ultimate frontman at this time.  Does it also seem like they played in smaller venues?  Since then, almost every live show I've seen has been at a huge stadium.  I guess I'm rambling, but what do you think of 1978 for the Stones?  What makes it so damn special?

In the late 70s Ellwood Blues said ‚ÄùY'know so much of the music we here today is pre-programmed electronic disco, we never get a chance to hear master blues men practicing their craft anymore. By the year 2006, the music known today as the blues will exist only in the classical records department of your local public library""

He was off by a few years, but imo the is very little music on the radio made by musicians ""practicing their craft"".

When is the last time you heard a song on the radio that wasn't recorded to a click track?

For me, I love rock music, but I don't love that world. I always respected men who lived in it who tried to rise above it, and Charlie was one of those men. He married his wife Shirley in 1964, and to all accounts was faithful to her for pretty much their whole marriage. When I think of Charlie I think of the story of the Stones going to the Playboy mansion and he went straight to the billiards room and wouldn't come out until the night was over. I think of Mick Jagger trying to get him to kiss a groupie on tour in 1969 and repeatedly refusing. I think of him on tour in 1975 telling a reporter that the Stones weren't as important to him as his family, or in a later interview recalling his drug addiction in the eighties and saying he ""almost lost everything"", meaning his family life. He conquered his relatively brief time with hard drugs by 1986, and remained the rock the Stones stood on for the next 35 years.

He is one of the great drummers of all time because of how he understood that virtuosity paled in comparison to interpreting the song, which he could do better than most. But as a man, he stands to me as what an artist should be. Not a role model, but a man who tries to live a good life.",2,1629835556

I mean how beautiful is it that the band was exiled off to warm-sunny Jamaica because of Keith's drug habit and were singing about a cold winter in the Northern Hemisphere. And here Mick sings about longing for a moment back in California with all the Christmas lights going out. The string arrangement at the end of the song is completely mesmerizing. It all just collides right there at the end with Mick Taylor's guitar and the strings. For the longest time, I used to think the final stanza of lyrics was ""Sometimes I wanna keep my coat around you, sometimes I wanna BURN A CANDLE FOR YA."" Listen closely but it's actually ""Sometimes I wanna keep my coat around you, sometimes I wanna BUT I CAN'T AFFORD YA."" So does anyone else rate Winter very highly in their Stones favorites?

It sounds like they basically did a second take of a total improv.  The lyrics are rambling anecdotes, and random shouts and whatnot.  Whenever it's not playing the refrain, the music is minimalist to the point of almost sounding like it's on a loop.

Maybe because the format is so unusual, I can't say I can think of another song that could be landed in the same category.  Rolling Stones or otherwise.  But then, I'm not all that familiar with music of this vintage (1983 I think).  The vintage, incidentally, is important.  I wouldn't get the same value out of something modern.

rollingstones,p144kh,gctlewis-,1,Could the Stones have continued without Keith?,"I was listening to an episode of the Disgraceland Podcast recently about the time in 1977 when Keith Richards was busted in Canada and was looking down the barrel of a long prison sentence for drug trafficking.

As we probably all know, fortune favoured the immortal one, and Keef, by virtue of the intervention of a kindly blind girl, escaped a custodial sentence after the trafficking charge was dropped. 

What really interested me though was the speculation about what would happen if Keith had been sent down for a minimum of seven years?

Richards was sure, without him, it would be over for his band, but allegedly, Mick said the show must go on and he intended to recruit another guitarist. Who could possibly replace the Human Riff?  Apparently, top of the list was Mick Taylor, who Jagger believed he could entice back to a Richardsless Stones.

Personally, I think the band wouldn‚Äôt have slowed down for a second without him. Keith is the heart and soul of the group but Jagger is the brains, and the Stones are the least sentimental group in the history of popular music. It would be business as usual. Now if this iteration would really be the Rolling Stones, and not just a good facsimile, is another question entirely.

What do you think would have happened to if Keith had been sent down? Does the band play on, and if so, with whom, and would it be the Rolling Stones in name only?",11,1628524162

Ronnie and friends cover Jimmy Reed‚Äôs track ‚ÄòShame, Shame, Shame‚Äô, originally released in 1963. Keeping true to Reed‚Äôs sound in their interpretation, the listener can sense their adoration for the late musician. The Rolling Stones previously included this song in their early setlists, along with others by one of their key influences Jimmy Reed. The B-Side of the Stones February 1964 UK hit single ‚ÄòNot Fade Away‚Äô is thought to have been a pastiche of ""Shame, Shame, Shame"". The incomparable Paul Weller features on the track and with its relatable lyrics and lively rhythm, this song has easy listening energy and has been covered many times before by numerous musicians.

When he makes a commitment, he keeps it. Whether it's to his wife or to his band. For him, they are the same thing. 

Keith has said that if Charlie quit, the band would end. It's easy to see why when you see how they are partners, as are Mick and Charlie. While everybody runs to Mick and Keith, they know how much they need Charlie. He's the all pro jazz musician of the group.",29,1628117986

Is there anything more like this? I‚Äôm hooked.,"I dismissed The Rolling Stones based on what fans of other bands have said about them.

Something about them either not being the best or just being overrated, or being thieves or something, or not measuring up to the Beatles, all just largely arrogant claims that come from people to appreciate a rock and roll band as a rock and roll band.

I‚Äôve just gotten into them, not too long ago, Mick Jagger has a great voice, and I‚Äôm into Keith Richard‚Äôs playing style, what little I‚Äôve been exposed to even though it might not be technically that brilliant.

I‚Äôm fascinated with the lore of Brian Jones, and what appears to be the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher curse of shuffling lead guitarists, but so far I‚Äôm hooked on Mick Taylor and I need to know if he did any more similar magic that really gets you going.

I don‚Äôt think I ever felt like I heard something so creative yet fitting than when I heard the solo from Sympathy in the Get Yer Ya-Ya‚Äôs Out live album. I‚Äôm on a mission to find more.

I think Mick Jagger himself puts it best: ""What's the point in listening to us doing I'm a King Bee when you can hear Slim Harpo do it?""

It's kinda interesting. Maria Mulduar (Midnight at the Oasis) sings a couple of songs and there is an instrumental version of what would turn into the backing track for (Si Si) Je Suis Un Rock Star. Lots of noodling synthesizers all over.

Dirty Work is the weaker of the two, and while I don't think it's as bad as people say (the Harlem Shuffle is a bop), it's hardly essential.

Undercover on the other hand - this is great! Why do people hate it? It's got a great, bloody, savage, raw sound, in some ways feeling like they took the spirit of Exile In Main Street and mixed it in with some 80s styles. Jagger is roaring like a man possessed, roaring out some of his darkest, angriest lyrics - listen to the percussion on Undercover, what an amazing, exciting drum sound. The guitars have real bite. She Was Hot has that great sexy chorus, Wanna Hold You is a great little rocker where Keith sounds good for once, Feel On Baby is a very different deep dubby cut, It Must Be Hell is a terrific closer that should have been a live staple - I could go on.

Musical and thematic styles were merged on the seven-minute ""Memory Motel,"" with both Jagger and Richards contributing lead vocals to a love song embedded within a life-on-the-road tale.

rollingstones,o8n84m,RyanKillian,1,Dirty Work: Steel Wheels Prologue?,"Hey all, 

Just listened to the infamously-maligned Dirty Work (1986) in one sitting for the first time all the way through. 

First impressions: it‚Äôs not nearly as bad as I was expecting.

Second impressions: I actually fuckin‚Äô like it, alot! 

The ‚Äòworst‚Äô aspect of the LP that jumped out at me was the flow. The songs didn‚Äôt exactly blend into each other in a natural way. ‚ÄúToo Rude‚Äù came out of nowhere and seemed very unproduced, and ‚ÄúBack to Zero‚Äù just seems chaotic and rambling, but other than those, I thought the material was solid considering what came before and what came afterward.

Being partial to Keith‚Äôs influence on the band over Mick‚Äôs, I was pleasantly surprised at the ‚Äúrocking‚Äù feel of most of the songs. I contend that ‚ÄúOne Hit (To The Body)‚Äù, ‚ÄúFight‚Äù, and ‚ÄúHold Back‚Äù could all have featured on Steel Wheels, while ‚ÄúHad it With You‚Äù is their obligatory (yet always good) ode to Chuck Berry. 

‚ÄúWinning Ugly‚Äù seemed to me to be reaching a little bit too hard to be a ‚Äúsporting-event anthem‚Äù after ‚ÄúStart Me Up‚Äù hit big in that field, but I still found myself tapping my feet to it nonetheless.

I don‚Äôt know what to think about ‚ÄúSleep Tonight‚Äù. It‚Äôs the one song on the album that puzzled me in terms of mood, feel, and message. I can‚Äôt tell if it was written with Keith‚Äôs kids in mind or one of the guys‚Äô girlfriends in mind. I think I liked it, but I don‚Äôt think it was right to close the record (I would have preferred it at the end of Side 1). 

Anyway, just wanted to share, one Stones fan to many others. I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts and disagreements/corrections on the most ‚Äòforgotten‚Äô album by the World‚Äôs Greatest Rock and Roll Band.",7,1624756523

rollingstones,o6mkfc,Stolling_Rones18,1,The stones are all great multi instrumentalists,"Along with their traditional duties (Charlie: drums, Keith: guitar, Brian: Guitar/ harmonica, Mick: vocals/ harmonica, Ronnie: guitar, Mick Taylor: guitar, Bill Wyman: Bass), the stones are all great multi instrumentalists, and I think it‚Äôs one of the reasons why the stones are so great

All the guitarists (Mick T, Keith, Brian &amp; Ronnie) play Acoustic, electric, &amp; slide guitars, and with the exception of Brian (at least not on record) played amazing bass guitar as well. Ronnie also plays a killer steel guitar. 

I don‚Äôt think I need to go in depth about Brian much because most of you all know already, but he played anywhere from 30-50 instruments, ranging from trumpets and keyboards to recorders and various percussion. He was also a killer slide and rhythm guitarist as well as harmonica player.

Mick J started playing guitar in the 70‚Äôs and did some killer riffs (sway, original brown sugar, winter, fingerprint file, heaven) and is also a great harmonica player with a sense of natural feel. He also plays keyboards occasionally, like on Hide Your love from goats head soup.

Bill Wyman is mostly bass, but occasionally takes on keyboards as well (in another land, time waits for no one) probably because of his keyboard lessons as a kid. Bill also handled background vocal duties in the early days. Charlie might be the least multi instrumentalist of them, mostly sticking to standard drums and percussion, but he does switch it up from time to time with the drums, such as playing a toy drum kit on Street Fighting Man, or playing pots and pans on Sweet Black Angel.

They weren‚Äôt virtuosos but were all versatile musicians, which is more important imo.",9,1624484118

June 1, 1947

The world of rock and roll has seen its fair share of rogues and renegades, and few are more lovable than Ronnie Wood. In over fifty years, he has seen it all and done it all, be it with a guitar hero, as a guitar hero, a writer, musician, artist, and as a member of the World‚Äôs Greatest Rock And Roll Band.

Born into a family of water gypsies, Ronnie‚Äôs was the first generation to be born on dry land. As the younger brother of musicians and graphic artists Art and Ted, the latter having played with Alexis Korner, Carlo Little, and as a member of The Artwoods, Ronnie inevitably followed in his brothers‚Äô footsteps as a musician. Beginning his career in The Birds, the band mixed old R&amp;B songs with originals, many being penned partly or fully by Ronnie. After The Birds ended, he‚Äôd move onto various other groups like freakbeat outfit The Creation and Santa Barbara Machine Head, an electric blues group featuring former Bands Bandmate Kim Gardner as well as future Deep Purple keyboardist Jon Lord. Both proved similarly short lived, but Ronnie would catch his first big break soon enough.

In 1967, Jeff Beck was fresh out of The Yardbirds and preparing to form his own group. It would be Ronnie and a young Rod Stewart with whom Jeff would form the core group. Initially on rhythm guitar, a revolving door of bassists would soon end with Ronnie switching over. As it turns out, Ronnie ended up being quite a good bassist, ably serving a rhythm guitarist‚Äôs role in complimenting Jeff‚Äôs guitar explorations while locking in with the drummer, be it with Aynsley Dunbar, Mickey Waller, or Tony Newman. Round out the band with the great Nicky Hopkins on keys, and with that, Jeff Beck‚Äôs new group was complete. And Jeff Beck‚Äôs group‚Äôs name? The Jeff Beck Group. Well, nobody can say the name is misleading.

With the blues that the band members grew up on, amped up in aggression and power and armed with Jeff‚Äôs innovative guitar work, Truth and Beck-Ola possess a sound so rarely if ever heard before they came out and which many have built on since. It‚Äôs pure, unadulterated hard rock, even metallic at times, especially for 1968, with pure sensuality and potency. It‚Äôs far out and cosmic without being hippy dippy, and still holds up nicely all these years later. Though the band was named for Jeff, the band truly felt like a band, one with tremendous talent and chemistry.

Of course, with all the talent in that band, perhaps the butting of heads was inevitable, and Rod and Ronnie would soon depart to work on Rod‚Äôs solo debut An Old Raincoat Won‚Äôt Ever Let You Down. At the same time, Steve Marriott departed from Small Faces to form his own band, and the remaining three members were contemplating their next move. To replace such a powerful voice AND a great rock guitarist, you‚Äôd quite possibly need two replacements for one. Then when Ronnie‚Äôs brother Art and old bandmate Kim Gardner put together a project called Quiet Melon, the five bandmates to be came together for the first time. And right there, Ronnie Lane, Ian MacLagan, and Kenney Jones knew exactly who their two replacements for Steve would be. But they couldn‚Äôt just continue as Small Faces; after all, Rod and Woody were too tall to be small faces. So they came up with a new name, and that name? Faces!

Though Small Faces had made their name as icons of the mod and British psychedelic scenes, Faces were an entirely different breed altogether. Pure, nitty gritty rock and roll, the blues feel that had been hinted at in Small Faces merged with the grittier sounds Rod and Ronnie had delivered with Jeff. Across records like Long Player, A Nod Is As Good As A Wink, and Ooh La La, the band delivered top notch, good time rock and roll. It was so pure, so organic, so lacking in pretense, music that‚Äôs not meant to thought of but felt. Back on guitar, Ronnie‚Äôs work is just sublime. He can truly rip it up on that six string, play some of the most blistering slide, yet there remains a real grit, full of heart and soul. He can play so beautifully in the slower numbers, and he can bring this rather playful character that just instantly projects a feeling of good times. Mix it in with Mac‚Äôs electric piano and organ, fill it out with Lane‚Äôs bass and Kenney‚Äôs drums, and top it off with Rod‚Äôs voice, and the five just produced magic, pure magic. And whereas the Stones were, well, the Stones, seemingly untouchable rock gods, Faces felt like the dudes you could hang out at the bar and joke around with like you‚Äôve known each other for years.

Besides guitars, Ronnie also offered some valuable contributions as a writer and on rare occasions as a vocalist. ‚ÄúPineapple And The Monkey‚Äù, the instrumental on First Step, ‚ÄúSweet Lady Mary‚Äù, ‚ÄúStay With Me‚Äù, ‚ÄúMiss Judy‚Äôs Farm‚Äù, ‚ÄúLove Lives Here‚Äù, ‚ÄúSilicone Grown‚Äù, ‚ÄúOn The Beach‚Äù, and perhaps most famously, ‚ÄúOoh La La‚Äù. The latter came after Rod and Lane had both given it a go and weren‚Äôt satisfied with their performances and producer Glyn Johns suggested Ronnie give it a go. Though he may not possess the vocal prowess of a Rod Stewart or a Ronnie Lane, Ronnie‚Äôs voice is just perfect for ‚ÄúOoh La La‚Äù. It perfectly embodies the cocky and naive boy gradually becoming a man that narrates the song as well as the regret and disappointment of an old man looking back on his life. At the same time, it has this nonchalant vibe so at home with melody and it ultimately gives the song that sense of shrugging and accepting that you win some and you lose some, that‚Äôs life. As much as I love Rod and Lane, I don‚Äôt think either could have bettered Ronnie‚Äôs vocal, a perfect example of perfect imperfection.

Come the mid seventies, Faces is coming to an end and Rod is wanting to put more focus on his solo career. Meanwhile, the Stones are in a weird transitional point of their career. They‚Äôve achieved rock icon status, they‚Äôre on top of the world. And yet, they‚Äôre in a weird funk, with everything just spinning out of control and in need of centering. In the midst of all of this, Mick Taylor departed and the band were left in need of a second guitarist. No shortage of guitarist were tried out or considered-Harvey Mendel, Wayne Perkins, Marriott, Beck, Peter Frampton...and Ronnie, a longtime friend of the band who also helped Mick develop ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Only Rock n Roll‚Äù.

Ultimately, it was Ronnie, Perkins, and Mendel who appeared on Black and Blue. In the midst of all these hot shot players, it was Ronnie who got the gig, and some have called this into question. But what‚Äôs forgotten is that it‚Äôs not always about getting the ‚Äúbest‚Äù player, it‚Äôs getting the right player. They didn‚Äôt really need a blazing virtuoso, and certainly didn‚Äôt want to be right back in the same spot in five years or see the second guitar position turn into a revolving door. They needed somebody who had a strong rapport with Keith, somebody that fit into the mix of personalities, and could help balance out Keith and Mick. Chemistry can be a funny thing, but as shown by ‚ÄúHey Negrita‚Äù, Ronnie just slid right in and everything just felt right at home.

Ronnie‚Äôs tenure has seen plenty of ups and downs, changing tastes, egos, addiction, disagreements (perhaps putting it mildly), all things that have taken down lesser bands. But not The Rolling Stones, not even close. Amazingly, Ronnie outlasted Brian Jones and Mick Taylor combined. Not only that, he‚Äôs now outlasted Bill Wyman. And when he and Keith hook up, when they play together, engage in that art of weaving that Keith always talks about, it just works.

As if he hasn‚Äôt done enough, Ronnie has also hosted a radio show, shown himself to be a talented artist, guest appear with The Band for their farewell show that became The Last Waltz, released some pretty strong solo records like I‚Äôve Got My Own Album To Do, Now Look, and Gimme Some Neck, appeared in film and television, play with Keith in The New Barbarians, collaborate with artists like Bobby Womack, George Harrison, Donovan, Bob Dylan, Aretha Franklin, BB King, The Rutles, Ringo Starr, and Beverly Knight. Not to mention reuniting with Faces and showing that they could still kill on stage, plus kicking cancer in the crotch twice.

What can I say? Ronnie is the man, and even if he screws up, I still love him all the same. When I finally saw the Stones at Bobby Dodd Stadium on the Zip Code Tour, Ronnie was easily the highlight, especially on ‚ÄúMidnight Rambler‚Äù. Happy belated birthday to Woody, may he enjoy many years of good health, sobriety, and happiness.[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E28BT2pXoAM82MC?format=jpg&amp;name=large](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E28BT2pXoAM82MC?format=jpg&amp;name=large)",3,1622865763

rollingstones,nrm76d,ZootMarimba,1,Happy 80th to Charlie Watts,"Charlie Watts  
June 2, 1941  
The Rolling Stones have become known as The World‚Äôs Greatest Rock And Roll Band, and no small part of that is thanks to Mr. Charlie Watts. With Charlie behind the kit, the Stones have the swing and the loose sense of controlled chaos that defines them at their very best.  
Beginning life in Bloomsbury, London, Charlie developed a great love of music and particularly jazz from a young age. Eventually taking up the drums, Charlie cut his teeth in various jazz groups while making a living as a graphic designer. He‚Äôd soon make his transition to rhythm and blues playing with Alexis Korner, and though the transition was a bit odd at first, Charlie more than adjusted. So much so, that a little up and coming band would soon seek his services.  
The Rolling Stones technically had several bass players and drummers before Bill and Charlie, several that played a gig or two, rehearsed with the band. Brian Jones and Keith Richards were a good team on guitars, Mick Jagger showed promise as a frontman, and Ian Stewart a great boogie woogie pianist. The band soon got Bill Wyman on bass, yet there was still that one missing piece of the puzzle, something that made the band feel complete. When seeing Charlie play with Alexis Korner, the band knew he was the man for them. Though he didn‚Äôt immediately accept, Charlie would soon take the job by January of 63, and The Rolling Stones were truly born.  
As the saying goes, if it don‚Äôt swing, it don‚Äôt mean a thing. Well, Charlie Watts makes sure it means a thing, his style and taste locking in immaculately with Keith‚Äôs guitar and Bill‚Äôs bass to give the band‚Äôs rock its roll. On a track like ‚ÄúGet Off Of My Cloud‚Äù it ‚ÄúMy Obsession‚Äù, he Can bringing an explosive power that, in many ways, is the basis of those respective tracks. On a cut like ‚ÄúSway‚Äù or ‚ÄúSlave‚Äù, Charlie Can cook a slow burn groove in a way that would make Al Jackson Jr proud. A lot of drummers can play fast, but how many can play slow, much less possess the stamina and discipline to maintain that steady rhythm?   
Beyond his drumming, Charlie has been a rock in many other ways. His deadpan personality is such a treat in interviews and videos, so perfect in responding to just how absurd rock stardom and celebrity can really be. Very creative in other ways, it was Charlie who provided the comic strip in Between the Buttons‚Äô gatefold and indirectly named the album. That 75 tour announcement with them playing on a flat bed? Charlie remembering the jazz bands who used to do that. Most of all, he has always been the more level headed figure in the midst of Mick and Keith‚Äôs fire and ice dynamic, able to keep things in perspective and move past the nonsense to focus on what‚Äôs important. No surprise, then, that the three have of them have outlasted the odds and have been together for nearly sixty years.   
Never forgetting his first love of jazz, Charlie has also enjoyed some decent success as the leader of his own big band during the Stones‚Äô downtime. In addition, he and Stu also had a boogie band of their own called Rocket 88 prior to Stu‚Äôs passing, and the band was a pretty hot unit if I do say so. Amazingly, in a business that can so easily take a toll on relationships, Charlie is still with the woman he fell in love with before the Stones took off, and has by all accounts remained ever faithful to her. You can say he didn‚Äôt have all the crazy stories a rock star is ‚Äúsupposed to have‚Äù, but guess what? When the tour is over, when he comes home, he knows there will be somebody there who will be there for him through thick and thin, and still would be even if he wasn‚Äôt the Stones‚Äô drummer.  
A class musician and gentlemen, I want to wish a happy 80th to Mr. Charlie Watts, may he enjoy many more years of good health and happiness. And people remembering not to call him Mick Jagger‚Äôs drummer.

rollingstones,nql8mz,HonestRef,1,Most Underrated Album?,"What album do you think is the most underrated or didn't receive the praise it deserves? And why?

For me Its Only Rock N Roll. Some people seem to be dismissive of this album and I'm not sure why. I think it's got everything a stones album should have. Ok it might not be as good as The big four albums, but I think it's up there with albums such as Some Girls and Tattoo You. 

IF YOU CAN'T ROCK ME

I think this is a great opener and sets the tone for the album. Some great guitar work from Taylor and Richards. Its pretty underrated. I'm surprised the stones didn't play this song live more. I thought this song would work even better in the live setting. 


AIN'T TO PROUD TO BEG

I think this is a pretty decent cover. I much prefer this cover to Harlem Shuffle in later years. Its upbeat and keeps the tempo moving. Some nice riffs from keith.


ITS ONLY ROCK N ROLL (But I Like It)

It's the big one, the hit single. Easily the most recognizable track on the album. Still a staple of their live shows. Works really well in the live environment. An excellent track. This track marks Ron Woods first involvement with the Stones as a guest appearance. 


TILL THE NEXT GOODBYE

A really nice ballad, underrated in my opinion. A universal subject matter that's still relevant today. Really nice accoustic guitar from Jagger and Richards with subtle electric from Taylor.


TIME WAITS FOR NO ONE 

Another criminally underrated song. Possibly the best on the album for me. Another universal subject matter. A masterclass from Mick Taylor. A great way to sign off on his stones career.


LUXURY 

this is the only week song on the album for me. It's not terrible but it's not great either. Compared to the songs mentioned above, this song is a comedown. I think it was the stones first attempt at reggae which they were becoming really interested in at the time.


DANCE LITTLE SISTER 

A nice up tempo rocker. Another song the stones should have done more often. A really nice guitar interplay from Rochards and Taylor. It's what the stones did best 


IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BE MY FRIEND 

A really nice ballad, in the same vain as Wild Horses and Angie. Really nice lyrics and a great vocals from Jagger. Really nice piano and organ work from Nicky Hopkins and Billy Preston respectively. And the backing vocals really add to the song too. 


SHORT AND CURLIES

The signature lighthearted song. She's got you by the balls. But this song has a killer chorus though. Nice bottleneck guitar from Taylor. Great job from Ian Stewart on piano. 


FINGERPRINT FILE

Great song about the surveillance of people of influence than was happening in the 70s. But the song is still really relevant today too with social media and all that stuff. Excellent vocal performance from Jagger. Sublime bassline from Bill Wyman too. This song is very different from everything else on the album and it received criticism for it. But I'm glad that it is because it showed me the direction that the stones ultimately took in future albums",29,1622638823

But it seems like no matter if it's a youtube video, a subreddit etc. these annoying beatles fangirls can't accept the idea that stones were good musicians as well

Besides, they were pretty much different music styles anyway, I don't get why everyone always feels the need to compare them

beatles fans are seriously the most toxic 60s-70s artist fangroup that there ever was

The song just has a great classic rock n roll sound. It's simple, loud and Jagger sings with aggression. Jimmy Page plays a mean solo and Keith has a great rhythm. 

I never see the song get a ton of respect because I think it gets overlooked because Dirty Work is a mediocre album. 

But it's a fun song and fun to play on guitar. It's simple but the song has an attitude about it, that makes it great for showing off.

rollingstones,n41uok,etn1130,1,What direction do you think the band would have gone in if Steve Marriott replaced Mick Taylor instead of Ronnie Wood?,"Steve Marriott is arguably the most underrated artist of the British Invasion. He was the lead singer of Small Faces, which featured him on guitar and vocals, as well as future Who drummer Kenney Jones (who replaced Keith Moon) and Ian McLagan, who played piano for a time with the Stones and was married to Keith Moon's ex girlfriend. While with the band, Small Faces recorded many great songs, led my Marriott's great singing voice. [Here he is doing a song that Led Zeppelin later ripped off](https://youtu.be/tp0jZ4BGuDw). 


He later joined Humble Pie with Peter Frampton and the Small Faces became the Faces, with Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood, formerly of the Jeff Beck Group, joining the band. Of course, we all know Ronnie Wood replaced Mick Taylor in the Stones. 




However, he wasn't their first choice. In 1975, after Mick Taylor left the band, the Stones auditioned Steve Marriott for the second guitar spot. Steve had been a friend of the Stones since Brian Jones had been in the band, he even sang backing vocals for a lot of songs on ""Their Satanic Majesties Request"". Him and Keith got along great, according to Ronnie Wood, joining the Stones was a dream for him. However, Mick Jagger apparently did not like Steve Marriott upstaging him during the audition, even though he apparently played great and worked well with Keith. Steve was a frontman with the Small Faces, so he knew how to get the crowd's attention just like Mick. Steve did not get the gig and it instead went to Ronnie Wood. Steve later died in a house fire in 1991 at 44 years old. 




My biggest wonder is where the band would have gone with Steve instead of Ronnie. Does Some Girls ever happen? Does Tattoo You sound different than how it initially does? Do you guys think that Ronnie was a better choice than Steve for the gig?",9,1620062693

rollingstones,n0wdhs,ZootMarimba,1,Happy 69th to Chuck Leavell,"Now to honor a fellow Southerner, and that‚Äôs none other than Mr. Chuck Leavell. For fifty some years, he‚Äôs been blessing us with his ivory magic. First cutting his teeth with soul singer Freddie North, Chuck moved to Macon on mentor Paul Hornsby‚Äôs recommendation. Here, he‚Äôd record with James Taylor‚Äôs older brother Alex and tour with Dr. John before finally catching the eye of Gregg Allman.

After providing some stellar keyboard work on Gregg‚Äôs solo debut Laid Back, the album that Gregg regarded as the pride and joy of his solo career, he and Johnny Sandlin introduced Chuck to the Allman Brothers Band. Reeling from the loss of Brother Duane, the band was left wondering just how to properly move forward without Duane, who could replace him? The answer, they realized, was nobody, so they decided to go in a completely different direction. And in Chuck, they found a pianist that could compliment Dickey Betts and fit in just right with the band, and even with the loss of Berry Oakley, the band nonetheless had a bright future with Chuck Leavell.

Starting with Brothers &amp; Sisters, Chuck proved an immensely brilliant addition to the band. While the lack of a second guitar might have taken some getting used to, his electric piano work along with the bass work of Jaimoe‚Äôs old friend and Berry‚Äôs replacement Lamar Williams helped give the new lineup a leaner, jazzier sense that was rather for the Allman Brothers. Where better to highlight Chuck than on ‚ÄúJessica‚Äù? And people sometimes forget, but the band were actually at their biggest when Chuck was in the band. So while nobody can ever truly take Duane‚Äôs place, Chuck did just alright, I‚Äôd say. So much so, Dickey would end up using Chuck for his own solo debut, Highway Calls.

As the Allman Brothers‚Äô original run came to an end, Chuck would offer his skills to many other great artists such as Bobby Whitlock, The Marshall Tucker Band, Charlie Daniels, and many others before creating a band of his own. With Lamar, Jaimoe, and guitarist Johnny Ness, Chuck confounded and fronted jazz fusion outfit Sea Level, which would prove to be quite a good band in their own right. With a nice mix of fusion, funk, blues, and Southern rock, Sea Level proved a viable group. Chuck, in particular, also showed himself to be a good writer and a strong singer, showing why he was front and center.

Of course, the things he‚Äôs mainly known for now would likely be his many years with the Stones. First jamming with them onstage in 1981, he would almost immediately replace Ian MacLagan on the recommendation of Sixth Stone Ian Stewart. Though he may not always get to flex his stuff in the Stones, the fact that he‚Äôs not only remained for forty years or so with them but also serves as music director is quite a testament to his skills. And frankly, knowing that an adopted son of my home state of Georgia is the Stones‚Äô keyboard player and music director is an immense source of pride for me.

Even through all the tours and records with the Stones, Chuck has still found time to play with a wide variety of talent such as Eric Clapton, Gov‚Äôt Mule, George Harrison, Train, The Fabulous Thunderbirds, and Montgomery Gentry as well as his work in tree farming and conservation.

Chuck is a simple man in the best way possible. He‚Äôs a gifted musician and artist and just a super cool, humble man who has happily blessed us with music for so many years without ever forgetting where he came from. God bless you, Mr. Leavell, and may you enjoy many more good years to come. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0HOGKPWYAgDtlk?format=jpg&amp;name=large",1,1619668915

I‚Äôm moving on- A Country song by Hank Snow originally featuring a violin, but Brian turned into a scorching slide guitar part

I Wanna Be Your Man- probably the first popular rock song featuring a slide guitar 

The last time- that famous riff 

The spider and the fly- probably my favorite Brian guitar solo

We Love You- The Arabian-like Mellotron playing, the tone is also amazing, no other band got that sound out of a Mellotron In 1967 and predicts Prog by a few years 

Jigsaw puzzle and 2000 Light Years Away from Home- His Mellotron parts give both songs a very eerie and mysterious feel

Mona- That Bo Diddley guitar, nobody else played like that besides Bo himself, who actually complimented his style

 *It was Amy who took the call from the producer* *Jack Nitzsche**,  ringing late one night in 1969 and hoping that Clayton would sing on a  track being recorded by the Rolling Stones. Still in her pyjamas, hair  in rollers and four months pregnant, she arrived at Sunset Sound Studios  in Hollywood minutes later, cementing her place in rock history with  her ferocious ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a shot away‚Äù vocal line on Gimme Shelter. ‚ÄúI  called Curtis: ‚ÄòThese boys want me to sing about rape and murder.‚Äô I  wanted them to hear me, talking real loud to my husband on the phone.  But we got the gist ‚Äì that it was part of the song and not something  just flying out of the sky. I was tired, it was cold and my voice  cracked. We listened back and they said: ‚ÄòOh that‚Äôs bloody fabulous. Can  you do it again?‚Äô‚Äù* 

 *The day after the session with the Stones, Clayton suffered a  miscarriage. She attributes it to the strain she put on her body pushing  the heavy studio doors and reaching to hit the vocal peaks. ‚ÄúWe lost a  little girl. It took me years and years and years to get over that. You  had all this success with Gimme Shelter and you had the heartbreak with  this song.‚Äù Although she recorded her own version of the song for her  1970 studio album (itself entitled Gimme Shelter), it took her a long  time to listen to the Stones‚Äô song because she so closely associated it  with losing her child. ‚ÄúIt left a dark taste in my mouth. It was a  rough, rough time.‚Äù*

A little background:

My partner and I are due our first baby in a couple months, and for the past 6-7 months have been stressing out over finding a house back home.


This will be our first time buying a house together as we currently rent a family members house put of town due to Covid/work.


For 6-7 months we have been knocked back on multiple homes due to the high demand in our area and very little homes coming to market. My pregnant Mrs. has enough on her plate and house hunting, viewing houses etc. has worn her down so much that she has been a wreck, stressing and panicking that she won't have anywhere close to family when baby arrives!


Fast forward to 3 days ago, up pops a beautiful house that is absolutely what we want. Straight away my partner gets in contact with the seller and enquires about a viewing.


On Saturday we were shown around the house by the sellers family member as he had work commitments. The house was absolutely pristine, not a spec of dust in sight and finished to a high standard. Better than anythind we had viewed before and within our price range. We were told that there were multiple other viewings after us and if we had any questions to just message the owner.


Later that night my partner received a message from the owner asking how we got on. Great! She replied, insisting that we loved the house and are really considering buying.


A few messages sent back and forth with the owner telling us all about the house, how things worked etc.


Then he told us that he would offer us the house for ¬£5,000 under the valuation, include all the TV's, large corner sofa and the hot tub in the price. He insisted for us to think about it and if we really wanted it he would inform the other parties interested that it was sold, and if anyone offered a higher amount he would stick to his word and decline their offer. He said one thing he has learned in life is not to be greedy.


I was gobsmacked, after all the stress we had been through this random stranger turns out to be the nicest guy we have ever met, willing to work with us and give us a month or so to get all our finances in order.

We were sold.

When we viewed the house I couldn't help but notice the owners love for The Rolling Stones. As soon as we walked in I instantly recognised the Stones' Tongue and Lips logo. It was everywhere. On the fridge, in the living room, a multitude of photos at concerts with his father, guitar on the living room wall, the whole sha-bang!

As a gesture of appreciation I would love to get this super fan a gift from my partner and I. I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on what to get that he might not have? A signed record/memorabilia? We have no idea. Any help is greatly appreciated!


TL;DR: my partner and I are buying a house off a Stones' superfan who it turns out is the nicest guy ever.",13,1615766730

rollingstones,lu4ki3,ZootMarimba,11,A Belated Happy 77th to Nicky Hopkins,"Now that I have his sketch done, allow me to honor the incomparable Nicky Hopkins, keyboardist with The Rolling Stones, The Kinks, The Jeff Beck Group, Jefferson Airplane, The Steve Miller Band, The Beatles, The Who, and so many more who would have turned 77 on Wednesday.

His name may not be a household one, but his work certainly is. A classically trained pianist with a golden touch on the ivories, Nicky was the man that virtually all of rock royalty in the 60s and 70s looked to for a way to enhance their sound. It‚Äôs him on the single edition of The Beatles‚Äô ‚ÄúRevolution‚Äù, contributing one of the few appearances by an outside musician in their discography. It‚Äôs him laying the stark piano down as Joe Cocker delivers ‚ÄúYou Are So Beautiful‚Äù, and providing the same heartbreak on Beatles solo cuts like ‚ÄúJealous Guy‚Äù and ‚ÄúPhotograph‚Äù. Did I mention that he‚Äôs one of the only people to play with all four Beatles in their solo career, his presence with Jefferson Airplane during their set at Woodstock, or the fact that he was offered a spot in Led Zeppelin as they were forming?

Because of his struggles with Crohn‚Äôs Disease, Nicky was not always able to tour, much less join a band full time. But when he got to do that, he truly made the most of it. There‚Äôs his time with the original Jeff Beck Group, making some truly excellent contributions to Truth and Beck-Ola, including his instrumental ‚ÄúGirl from Mill Valley‚Äù. There‚Äôs his brief stints with San Francisco‚Äôs Quicksilver Messenger Service, most notably shining on ‚ÄúEdward, The Mad Shirt Grinder‚Äù, and Steve Miller Band in their early years. 

And of course, his extensive relationships with The Stones, The Who, and The Kinks. Contributing to all of The Kinks‚Äô mid sixties efforts (Kontroversy through Village Green) and to all but one Stones album from 1967‚Äôs Satanic through 1981‚Äôs Tattoo You but especially the Big Four of 68-72, Nicky provided a crucial buttress as both bands truly came into their own artistically and as Ray Davies and The Glimmer Twins matured as songwriters. Over the years, Nicky would color and brighten tracks such as ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs A Rainbow‚Äù, ‚ÄúSympathy For The Devil‚Äù, ‚ÄúGimme Shelter‚Äù, ‚ÄúAngie‚Äù, ‚ÄúWaiting On A Friend‚Äù, and countless others. No surprise, then, that the Kinks would write a track for Nicky called, what else, ‚ÄúSession Man‚Äù. And while not quite to the same degree, you also have his work with The Who, appearing on ‚ÄúAnyway, Anywhere, Anyhow‚Äù, My Generation, Who‚Äôs Next, By Numbers, and the Tommy soundtrack, each being made that much more powerful by Nicky‚Äôs presence.

Highly versatile, Nicky could tackle any style with ease, be it rock, blues, jazz, gospel, or baroque. His sound was so elastic yet so distinct, always possessing a delicate touch that always became one with the music. He not so much played the song but conjured it‚Äôs essence, practically becoming one with the song. And as befitting Nicky himself, his playing was highly sensitive and giving, always willing to offer a helping hand wherever and whenever needed. He was a generous and humble artist, never demanding the spotlight or credit and perfectly happy to play his part in the greater whole.

Sadly, Nicky has not been with us in some time, and the world is much emptier without him in it. Everything he ever played was just right on, always knowing just what, where, and when to play or not play. He was the true definition of a musician, one who made everybody around him better. But of course, the love, the heart, the soul he put into every record he played has played no small part in keeping his spirit alive. Happy birthday Nicky, thank you for all you ever gave us in your time in the world. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvSI4znXAAYqNpr?format=jpg&amp;name=large",0,1614483321

I went through phases of being obsessed with the Beach Boys, Beatles, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, etc. but have never been into the Stones. I went through some of their bigger albums (Exile, Sticky Fingers) and they still didn't click with me. I get why people love them, it's objectively good music, just never been for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Today on a whim I decided to pick a random Stones album from the 60's to listen to. I cued up Between the Buttons and from start to finish was mesmerized! This is such a fantastic album! I thought about how exciting it is to have a new album like this where I can play it everyday and dive deep into it. Does anyone else feel this way about Between the Buttons? It has the perfect mix of sophisticated pop, British invasion rock, blues, and psychedelia. There isn't a single skippable song on this. Both versions (UK and US) really rocked my world.",9,1614008901

If you want a deep, eloquent dive into the album from hardcore fans then it's great reading.

One of his best ones is Torn and Frayed: [https://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/exile-on-main-street-song-by-song-musical-production-analysis.662476/page-14#post-16277756](https://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/exile-on-main-street-song-by-song-musical-production-analysis.662476/page-14#post-16277756) \- that and the comment below it got me listening to the song again and yes, in my opinion it is a truly great song, maybe one of the best on the album.

rollingstones,l3hwxv,ProcessLive,2,"Keith Richards interpretation of Brian Jones in his memoir ""Life"".","I felt like there was a huge misunderstanding between the then boys. And Keith portrayed. Brian in his memoir as a receding artist who was the ""author of his own misfortunes"" as said by either Charlie or Mick (I can‚Äôt remember).

I obviously wasn‚Äôt there or know/knew any of them personally, but I can‚Äôt help but feel a lot of Keith‚Äôs remarks are bogus; told from the way he wants himself to be remembered. And he just used his ""tell it like it is"" persona to back all of his statements.

Brian‚Äôs involvement in the group dwindled (as said by Charlie Watts) because of a number of reasons that led up to his inevitable departure. He was a natural leader and a good one too. Brian was original, while Mick always wanted to follow through a more mainstream trend for acceptance and ultimate success.

I believe Brian‚Äôs decline in The Rolling Stones started in the change in management, and the said management most notably favouring Keith and Mick as the more prominent artist of the group. But the real climax, tipping point was Keith taking Anita. 

I doubt Anita and Brian were in love but they certainly built a love for each other if that makes sense. However, Keith loved Anita no doubt. Anita was probably was and still is the love of his life. Brian, naturally, sought this all to be very difficult but found it hard to leave (the band).

Keith speaks as truthfully as he allowed himself to on Anita. They got together when she supposedly blew him in a car somewhere. He shows mercy on her because of his remaining love but as for Brian, he was but an old friend that once indirectly threatened his placement.

Anita probably blew Brian a couple times while with Keith. She certainly got around after Brian‚Äôs death and her and Keith‚Äôs marriage. I‚Äôm only saying this because I think Keith‚Äôs interpretation towards certain people, (like Brian) whether justified or not, were heavily influenced by his irrelevant feelings towards them.

Brian‚Äôs death was undoubtedly a relief to The Rolling Stones. They can‚Äôt even hide their satisfaction with it. Brian was of tremendous talent, he was getting himself together all while getting a musical project together with the likes of very big names like Bob Dylan and John Lennon. No doubt, he would‚Äôve succeeded and this would‚Äôve griped The Stones something awful.

Now I‚Äôm not saying any of them had anything to do with his death. That‚Äôs a whole other ballgame that I don‚Äôt want to get into right now. But I‚Äôm just saying that it was really convenient to the Stone‚Äôs pride and well being as a profitable band that he died when he did; before he could make his next move free of The Stones restraints.

I could go on but I‚Äôll just leave this here. There‚Äôs a [video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8DkqhLey-0Q) of a reporter asking Keith if he‚Äôd feel comfortable about Mick telling his story to which he nodded it off with a bogus response. Naturally, Stones fans took to his side but it all speaks for itself. Keith knows deep inside what the interviewer is asking of and he chooses to believe otherwise and run away.",11,1611428132

rollingstones,l1sjzb,ZootMarimba,1,A Belated Happy 72nd to Mick Taylor,"I‚Äôm a bit behind on things, but I want to post a tribute for none other than the great Mick Taylor, Rolling Stones guitarist who turned 72 on the 17th.

Beginning his career by playing impromptu with John Mayall‚Äôs Bluesbreakers at the tender age of 16 when Clapton didn‚Äôt show up for a show, Taylor simply played a handful of numbers and left with his friends afterward. Yet he left such an impression that when Mayall needed a guitarist to fill in for Peter Green, it was this young lad that proved the ideal choice for a guitarist. And so it was Mick Taylor that played on records such as Crusade, Bare Wires, and Blues From Laurel Canyon, appearing through the remainder of the Bluesbreakers‚Äô existence and then the beginnings of John Mayall‚Äôs solo career. With this notoriety, Taylor became the new hot shot in London‚Äôs blues scene.

But of course, it was with a rock and roll band that Mick Taylor achieved his greatest success. When the Stones parted ways with Brian Jones, that left a lot of uncertainty. Even for all the ups and downs with Brian, he was a significant figure in the band, one of its most famous members, and the man who opened the Pandora‚Äôs Box on top of the Stones gumbo. Likewise, they‚Äôre going out after a long absence form the road, really need to give a bang for the audience‚Äôs buck, have somebody with real chops that could compete with the best players on the scene, AND still compliment the Stones as a unit. And thanks to Mayall and Stu, they found their answer in Mick Taylor.

Joining as the band near the end of recording on Let It Bleed, Taylor would appear on ‚ÄúCountry Honk‚Äù, ‚ÄúLive With Me‚Äù, and the single ‚ÄúHonky Tonk Women‚Äù. Though not blazing like he could and would, his impact is still immediate. His guitar work really beefs up the sound of the band, giving it a muscle and power that hadn‚Äôt been there before. On stage, this same power added a sense of full throttle adrenaline that pushed the band to become that much better, as perfectly captured on Get Yer Ya-Ya‚Äôs Out!, one of the best live albums of all time. And nowhere does Taylor shine brighter than on his take on ‚ÄúMidnight Rambler‚Äù. Despite the track having been recorded before his arrival, he made it entirely his own song as he conjured the dark menace and the cold sweat of the lyrics, making the song cinematic in a way that not even the studio version achieved, as great as it already was.

And that was just the beginning. From there, he‚Äôd make his proper debut on Sticky Fingers and play on record like Exile On Main Street and Goats Head Soup, and be it shading the music such as on ‚ÄúBitch‚Äù or ‚ÄúMoonlight Mile‚Äù, or truly torching earth on cuts like ‚ÄúSway‚Äù, ‚ÄúWinter‚Äù, or ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt You Hear Me Knocking?‚Äù. His playing is filled to the brim with passion, rooted in the blues while having the improvisational flair of a jazz player. His work is so fluid and lyrical, opening up the doors to what the Stones could do, even as great as they already were and are.

With the Stones, you of course have Mick Jagger the showman and Keith Richards the rock and roller. But then you have that third wheel, the artist who is always longing for something and can nudge the Glimmer Twins and the band as a whole into new territory. Brian had previously served this role, and Taylor took it over upon his own arrival. He wasn‚Äôt the multi instrumentalist that Brian was, but he certainly didn‚Äôt suffer for it. With his guitar work, he could take the music into a dimension just as Brian did, enriching the Stones‚Äô music every bit as much as Brian had. People can debate between the two all they want, but really it‚Äôs just one form of brilliance against another.

Of course the Stones is Mick Taylor‚Äôs biggest claim to fame, but even during and after his time with the band, he‚Äôd still managed to deliver his talent to other artists, be it with Billy Preston, Jack Bruce, Mike Oldfield, Carla Olson, and Herbie Mann. That‚Äôs him playing the solo on Joan Jett‚Äôs ‚ÄúI Hate Myself For Loving You‚Äù, him dueling with Lowell George on ‚ÄúApolitical Blues‚Äù off Waiting For Columbus and introducing me to the great Little Feat in the process, and him playing with Bob Dylan on Infidels. Even amongst his fellow Stones, he‚Äôs the only other Stone on Keith‚Äôs Talk Is Cheap and he contributed to eventual successor Ronnie Wood‚Äôs first two solo efforts.

Simply put, he‚Äôs Mick Taylor, and we‚Äôre not. Happy birthday Mick, thank you for your fantastic guitar playing and mojo. The world sucks a little bit less thanks to you. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EsO422EWMAAzb5w?format=jpg&amp;name=large",9,1611209556

Growing up, my mom and dad both had great tastes in music. I can remember car rides listening to the Loop and other Chicagoland radio stations, not knowing the glory of what I was listening to. As I got to college, I remember I started listening to oldies and knew all the words to these songs yet I didn‚Äôt even know who they were by half the time.

Then I heard it. Honky Tonk Women. That cowbell, my god. The sweat and roughness of that song. I was infatuated with it, couldn‚Äôt get enough of that song. From that point on (around 2014) I dove deeper and deeper into the Stones. I‚Äôve seen them twice now (Amsterdam ‚Äò17 and Chicago ‚Äò19). 

Every day I discover something new with them. Even if it‚Äôs a song I‚Äôve heard 1000 times. Maybe a new emotion, a subtle guitar lick, or a muddy live version of a favorite track, my journey never ends and I‚Äôm so happy I‚Äôve found them.

I got to say as much as I love Keith, it seems the whole book he‚Äôs documented history the way he felt it should‚Äôve been.

He‚Äôd say yeah, I was jealous about this when I was a kid and that but never what really seemed to be seen by everyone else at the time and now.

Keith seems to undermine Brian. As an original Stone of the three, he has the leverage to say what he wants with ""I was there"" as his evidence. And if we don‚Äôt believe it, we‚Äôre full of shit. Maybe Ian Stewart was a founding member. But other sources would site Brian as just that. It leads me to believe Keith wasn‚Äôt 100% as ""honest"" as he claimed to be.

That being Said, Sway might be my favorite Stones sway. It's the perfect combo of being a rock power ballad and a blues ballad. When I listen to Sticky Fingers when I hear Brown Sugar, I picture the boys in a smokey and shady blues dive bar huddle around a piano and the night just beginning. The bar is full and everyone is just getting their drinks.

When I hear Sway I picture the same bar but only the broken, bar flys and drunks are left. The night is old, last call just happened and it's a great closing song. But it's the second track.

**Q: How well did the Stones get on with the Beatles?** 

A: Very well. Of course, there was a lot of competition but the  Beatles were always hugely more popular and had a head start on us. They  were so massive and there‚Äôs never been a band since that‚Äôs been so big.

But we got on very well with them and they were very helpful to us.  They gave us a song, which was one of our first top 10 hits in England.  They were really very easy to get on with. But they weren‚Äôt always nice  to everybody.

rollingstones,kgn98u,ZootMarimba,1,A late happy 77th for Bobby Keys,"Next up, the great Bobby Keys, who would have also turned 77 yesterday.

Mr. Brown Sugar, Mr. Saturday Night, Keith Richards‚Äô brother from another mother. The man who first showed me just how much a saxophone could ROCK. Horns in rock can be pretty hit or miss, but if you got Bobby there, it would almost certainly be a hit. Then again, this is a guy who spent part of his youth listening in on Buddy Holly‚Äôs rehearsals. He didn‚Äôt have to be taught rock and roll, he lived, breathed, drank, and ate it. To paraphrase Donald ‚ÄúDuck‚Äù Dunn, he had a sound that could turn goat piss into gasoline. 

Debuting with the band on Let It Bleed, Bobby came in right as the band was finding their identity without Brian Jones and morphing into the Stones as we know and love them today. On ‚ÄúLive With Me‚Äù, you have this down and dirty rock and roll boogie number, and enhancing that swing is Bobby‚Äôs solo. Full of swagger, raunch, and pure sweat and passion, it just fits so perfectly that you can‚Äôt imagine a guitar solo doing any better. And then he‚Äôd repeat this on ‚ÄúBrown Sugar‚Äù, which did initially have a guitar solo before Bobby came up with a little something. Along with Mick Taylor and fellow sideman Jim Price on trumpet, Bobby helped give the Stones a muscular sound and backbone they hadn‚Äôt quite had before, even as great as the music was already. And with them, the pallet widened to allow the band to craft some of their most brilliant works like Sticky Finger and of course Exile On Main Street. Despite a couple breaks and both Jim and Taylor breaking away by the mid seventies, Bobby was never too far away from the world of the Stones. And thank God for it, because even though the band could get some stellar players like Ernie Watts and SONNY ROLLINS, nobody ever quite got the band like Bobby did. Though considering he and Keith were born on the same day, that makes sense.

And besides the Stones connection, there‚Äôs all Bobby managed to do elsewhere. His time with Delaney &amp; Bonnie And Friends, where George Harrison and Eric Clapton both started to find their voices outside of their original bands. Then appearing on George's All Things Must Pass, several of Ringo's early singles such as ‚ÄúPhotograph‚Äù, John Lennon‚Äôs only Number One solo hit with ‚ÄúWhatever Gets You Through the Night‚Äù, Lennon and McCartney‚Äôs only post Beatles jam together, Warren Zevon‚Äôs major label debut, Lynyrd Skynyrd‚Äôs ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Ask Mr No Questions‚Äù and ‚ÄúCall Me The Breeze‚Äù, Hor Cocker‚Äôs Mad Dogs and Englishmen, Carly Simon during her heyday, and so on.

Besides being a great player, Bobby was a man without any pretensions, one who always enjoyed a good laugh and who always seemed like such a cool dude to hang out with. Sucks he isn‚Äôt here anymore, but I also know he wouldn‚Äôt want any frowns. So I‚Äôll just crank his records. Happy birthday Bobby, may you Rest In Peace wherever you are. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EppwbsVXEAEX454?format=jpg&amp;name=large",3,1608437290
rollingstones,kgn8eq,ZootMarimba,1,A late happy 77th to Keith Richards,"How about a round for the man, the myth, the legend, Mr. Keith Richards, guitarist and founding member of The Rolling Stones who turned 77 yesterday.

From the very beginnings all the way to the present day, Keith has been the rock of the Stones. The cool, low key foil to Mick Jagger‚Äôs flamboyance, Keith is an idea and an example that many, many, MANY have tried to emulate, and none even come close. They might be able to play the chords, they might be able to pose like a rock star, but they don‚Äôt have the attitude, the steadfast determination, or the insight.

You can talk virtuosity and flashy leads all you want, and lord knows I love quite a bit of that, but try getting the feel down. Try to have the kind of impeccable timing, the perspective, and the insight on how to tie everything together. That‚Äôs what Keith can do and do better than most. He‚Äôs the man the band follows on stage, and as risky as it can be (then again, this IS the Stones), it‚Äôs led to some of the greatest moments in rock and roll. Indeed, the band isn‚Äôt called the World‚Äôs Greatest Rock And Roll Band for nothing, and Keith is no small part of that. He can‚Äôt do what guys like Brian Jones, Mick Taylor, or Ronnie Wood can do, but they can‚Äôt do what he does either. 

Then you get to songwriting. He and Mick don‚Äôt always get as much focus in this sense, but seriously, look at the body of work they‚Äôve created. So many classic singles and albums to their name, one rooted in rhythm and blues and roots music while feeling so fresh and versatile all the same. Over the years, they‚Äôve been able to incorporate country, gospel, psychedelia, world music, reggae, punk, disco, and New Wave while remaining uniquely Stones esque. 

While Keith is known as the purist and the hardened outlaw, and there‚Äôs certainly some truth to that, he‚Äôs far from a one trick pony. Let‚Äôs not forget, this is the guy who wrote ‚ÄúAngie‚Äù and the lyrics to ‚ÄúRuby Tuesday‚Äù, two of the most noted Stones ballads, plus naming one of his guitars after a Charles Dickens character. Indeed, there‚Äôs always been more to him than meets the eye, and that is perhaps the biggest reason why nobody has ever been able be him, and nobody ever will be. 

So here is to a man who any lover of rock and roll has got to love, may he continue taking no prisoners. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EppwbsRXIAE3nN8?format=jpg&amp;name=large",4,1608437189

rollingstones,keyqnn,JohnJackField,1,Who Should Play the Gang in FX‚Äôs Rolling Stones Series?,"I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve all heard about The New Rolling Stones Series being brought to us by the same people who are making The Crown so I was wondering who you think should play the Band Members? Keep in mind the first 2 seasons will span from 1960-1972!

Mick:

Mick is a bit of tricky one as they need to cast someone who could play a good Mick without  it being a complete Caricature. Bill Skarsgard definitely has the Chops and the Face, but he‚Äôs just way too tall. I‚Äôve heard a lot of people mention Harry Styles and while he can act (Dunkirk) I doubt with his music career really taking off he‚Äôd want to commit to a TV show 

Keith:

Timothee Chalamete has the chops and a good enough resemblance to play Keith, 

Brian:
Charlie Heaton or Rubert Grint aka Ron Weasily would be a good choice 

Charlie, Bill, Mick Taylor:

Cast unknowns for these roles",9,1608216490

rollingstones,kcgwyv,ZootMarimba,1,A Late Happy 59th to Darryl Jones,"I must wish a late happy birthday for the great Darryl Jones, longtime sideman and bassist for The Rolling Stones, Sting, and Miles Davis among many others who turned 59 on Friday.

In a career spanning forty years or so, Darryl has found himself in the realms of countless accomplished artists across many styles and genres. From jazz giants like Miles and Herbie Hancock, blues men like B.B. King, soul legends like Patti Labelle and Earth,Wind,&amp;Fire‚Äôs Philip Bailey, pop stars like Madonna and Sting, all the way to the World‚Äôs Greatest Rock And Roll Band, Darryl has proven equally adept in all settings.

With Miles, Darryl became a valuable part of The Prince of Darkness‚Äô comeback period that saw some of the biggest shows and tours of his career and appearing on records such as Decoy and You‚Äôre Under Arrest which show Miles adapting to the pop/soul, funk, and electronic music of the era while remaining quintessentially Miles. During this time, he‚Äôd also support Sting as he was beginning his solo career, appearing on Dream of The Blue Turtles as well as the following tour and the documentary Bring On The Night. Then playing with Peter Gabriel at the Human Rights Now! shows in 1988, Gil Evans near the end of his life, Neil Young, Ziggy Marley, Otis Clay, you name it.

Also set Sting up to play a French cop on You‚Äôre Under Arrest, true story!

But of course, what I and many others first know him for is his many years with the Stones. Chosen by Charlie Watts, Darryl joined as a sideman after Bill Wyman stepped down and has proven an ever reliable figure since then. While he doesn‚Äôt get to stretch out like he did with the likes of Miles, Darryl is as tight a player as you could ask for and locks in nicely with Charlie. Plus his solo during ‚ÄúMiss You‚Äù has often proven a strong point in most recent tours, including when I saw the Stones in 2015. 

Darryl may not be a household name, but his career and resume speaks for itself. Happy birthday Darryl, and may you enjoy many more good years. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EpJAXaeWMAEMQL5?format=jpg&amp;name=large",1,1607887771

You may not be familiar with the Spanish duo Azucar Moreno, but they were one of the biggest Pop acts in Spain and Latin America in the 1980s and 1990s. On their wildly successful fifth album *Mambo*, they did a recording of Painted Black called ""Paint, It Black"". They made it very theatrical obviously, the group is mostly well-known for singing songs in Spanish with Arabic beats and sounds. 

Spanish is my first language, this was technically the first song by The Rolling Stones I have ever heard, and it was what introduced me to their music and I have been a fan since. I still really love Azucar Moreno's cover of the song though, just thought I'd post it here in case some of you may not know about it (assuming so lol).

rollingstones,jwvp10,Deuter_2020,1,Trying REALLY HARD to be able to rejoin IORR,"Does anyone know how I would successfully be able to rejoin IORR to post?

I was on for only TWELVE DAYS before that unkind, very rude, very evil, narcissist of a boss gave me the BOOT PERMANENTLY for reasons that are UNTRUE.

I broke absolutely ZERO rules. 

Bjornulf is a VERY VERY MEAN MEAN MEAN MEAN SELFISH PIG for kicking me off + he's a fucking dickhead for refusing to re-allow me posting access.

I have been in a dispute trying to regain posting access for OVER a year and a half (February 2019) but it STILL isn't working all this time. 

I have emailed him MANY times but he just doesn't seem to give a rat's ass that I want my posting access back. 

First: February 12, 2019. I try to log in to post and I get the note that my account is marked invalid &amp; that I need to contact him for information. I send him one email he doesn't write back to. A few hours later I send another one that then very early the next morning (in my region) I get a response from him saying that my posting access was closed due to reports (I DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG - A VERY UNNECESSARY REMOVAL), I reply to that message saying again I did NOTHING to cause closure &amp; I would like it reopened and that I'll complain to someone about him. The next day (Valentine's Day) I send a lengthy angry email saying that I had just gotten on and I did nothing to cause complaints. I tell him I've reached someone on him that can't do anything &amp; that if he won't let me back on I'll reach them again &amp; ask them to refer me elsewhere. He responds saying it's not a public right to post on his site - ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT &amp; VERY UNFAIR (I hope he's doing that as a lie to make up a reason for why he refuses to allow me to post again), I reply saying that No one should've filed any reports because I did nothing wrong, I end by angrily explaining ""YOU WILL GIVE ME POSTING ACCESS"" which he does not reply to. Three weeks &amp; I email him again saying I want my account reopen and that he will be reported if that doesn't happen. That message is ignored. a little over a month &amp; a half go by and I angrily email him again, I receive the same Bullshit response I received on Valentine's Day, I respond angrily saying I was freely able to set up my account and I want it reopen, That's when I reach the point of getting a bit colorful towards him, he responds saying it's unacceptable, then I reply saying it was WRONG that he removed me because I did absolutely NOTHING wrong I also write angrily I want another chance or I will find someone to deal with him. A couple days pass and I try again: this is a period of many many ignored emails: TEN ignored emails sent May 1, May 5, May 26, May 27, June 2, June 9, June 11, June 12, July 17 (plus a tweet the same day) &amp; August 2 of 2019 (plus one Facebook message on July 22, 2019).

December 2019: I send him another email wanting another chance, Two days later: He responds saying he reported offending threats, What he reported was NOT offending threats, I respond asking if I got another chance, He responds still claiming the things reported were offending, I respond saying I did not do anything offending &amp; that when I say I want to find someone to deal with him that's me saying I am going to tell on him. One week later (Christmas Eve): I reference the previous week's email how I want to return to the forum + I was not given indication as to if it was a yes to me rejoining &amp; asking if I will get that chance. He responds (Christmas Day by now): Again WHAT A MORON he is. His answer is STILL NO because of numerous offensive posts (NOT TRUE), Offensive comments (ALSO NOT TRUE), Attacks on him as an editor (I NEVER ONCE PERSONALLY ATTACKED HIM AS AN EDITOR). January 12, February 2 &amp; twice November 6 I send FOUR MORE ignored Facebook messages, On December 27, 29, 30, January 9, January 18, January 26, February 9, February 12, February 17, March 24, April 2, May 19, June 19, July 23, September 21, September 28, November 5 &amp; November 16 (this week) I have sent EIGHTEEN emails that have ALL Been Ignored because he is RUDE + I have found his Instagram and sent THREE messages on November 7 asking to have a chance back on (all of which have been ignored). I literally don't want to stop until I'm allowed back on. 

HE REMOVED ME BEHIND MY BACK without ANY advanced notice.

Has anyone else had problems with this PIG the way I have?

This Horrible Horrible human being that he is.",3,1605758749
rollingstones,jwu4qf,_Davis2,0,Why do some fans dislike Keith and Mick?,"I do not consider myself to be a surface level Stones fan, pretty sure I've heard every single song they produced at least once over the decade I've been listening to them. That being said I feel like when I talk to other big fans of the boys, often the have some level of distain towards Mick, Keith and sometimes Ronnie too. These people tend to favor Charlie, Bill and Especially Brian. Obviously every single member of the band apart from maybe MT have shady pasts but why so much hatred towards the two most popular? Lately I've been theorizing that it might just be that, they hate the fact that Mick and Keith are more popular than the very talented band members who surround them but I'm curious to hear if there are like stories I haven't heard pf them being dickeads or something.",16,1605752773

Overall it's a really nice snapshot of the Steel Wheels tour.  I think it's a much better listen than Flashpoint, which I always felt unnecessarily overproduced.

Song variety is nice; heavy on hits with some of their more recent 80s material and some songs like Midnight Rambler and Sympathy for the Devil they hadn't broken out in almost 15 years at that point, so you can really hear the enthusiasm of the band in tracks like those.",4,1601326029

We came across a video of Mick practising choreography backstage (recent) and then seeing the finished product, him throwing off his coat as part of the choreography of the performance on some kind of awards show?? We've been trying to find it ALL night and it's as though it were a shared hallucination. Does anyone have a link to either video, preferably the backstage choreography.

PS: Another thing we remember is that an offscreen choreographer emphatically asserts: ""JACKET!"" when Mick is supposed to fling off said jacket. It was more of a trench coat. Thanks for reading- PLEASE let us know... it would make our day!

rollingstones,ij1i1n,wiglwagl,1,I finally found a song I remembered from childhood and have been trying to find for years.,"TLDR: It was Memo from Turner by Mick Jagger.

My brother was a big Stones fan and he died a few years ago. After he died, I recalled a distant memory of a song that he used to play when we were kids that I really liked, but I couldn‚Äôt remember the words or melody at all. It‚Äôs has been bugging me that I couldn‚Äôt find that song.

All I remembered was the ‚Äúfeel‚Äù of the song. Kind of funky, with a very ‚Äúclose‚Äù sound in Mick Jagger‚Äôs voice (not a lot of reverb.) And the song ends abruptly after a long held note. That‚Äôs all I had to go on.

I‚Äôve listened to every studio album by the Stones, focusing on the ends of the songs to try to jog my memory. I could never find it. I‚Äôve tried and given up hope several times, and decided that maybe I just misremembered some other song.

I told my son my story and he pointed out that maybe it was on some kind of ‚Äúrarities‚Äù album or some other album with one-off songs, so I started listening to those too.

On the compilation album ‚ÄúMetamorphosis‚Äù, I finally found the song ‚ÄúMemo from Turner‚Äù, though it didn‚Äôt sound  like I remembered. I think that version was a demo.

I searched the name and found it on the soundtrack for the 1970 film ‚ÄúPerformance.‚Äù It is indeed a one-off, and I think it‚Äôs solo Mick Jagger, though it definitely sounds very Stonesy.

Anyway, mystery solved, I‚Äôve played the song about fourteen times today and it‚Äôs just as good as I remember it. I‚Äôm probably going to get super sick of it, but until then, I really do like that song.

That‚Äôs all, hope this wasn‚Äôt too boring!",6,1598739765

*Processing img 4dtjc6p0pud51...*

Amazing listen.. one of the, if not the best Stones album imo.. 

Also noteworthy.. I know music historians like to name artists such as Iggy Pop &amp; the Stooges, MC5, Patty Smith, Death, etc during the mid-1970s as the first or earliest ""proto-punk"" bands, however in my personal opinion, this is the one of the earliest proto-punk albums, especially with songs such as 'Citadel' which is reminiscent of the sound and style that Iggy Pop and MC5 would create later on and was labeled as proto-punk.

Take a listen:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9KJAeM3NCc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9KJAeM3NCc)

What do you think?

&amp;#x200B;

The cover:

*Processing video 619q53syoud51...*

Unfortunately my phone's camera doesn't pick up on the effect all that well and doesn‚Äôt do the cover's lenticular image any justice; it doesn't capture the depth that you can see with your eyes, such as that castle behind them and other elements are in the background appear in the distance, also when viewed in person, the image shows the band members' faces turning towards each other while Jagger keeps staring straight and his arms go from wrapped in his cloak to crossed in front of him.",1,1596052378

One of the greatest frontmen that ever lived, has co-led the World‚Äôs Greatest Rock And Roll Band for over fifty years, his drive and perfectionism has played no small part in making the #RollingStones as great as they are. Any frontman who came after has taken a page or two out of Mick‚Äôs book, the man can hold an audience in the palm of his hand in a way that few others can. As far as a rock songwriter goes, he and Keith don‚Äôt get enough credit as far as I‚Äôm concerned. Their ability to fuse the blues into this great melting pot of rock is uncanny, and they‚Äôve been able to adapt their writing time and time again while still remaining quintessentially Jagger/Richards. Mick‚Äôs ability to portray the very essence of rock and roll in lyric form has few peers or rivals, and his swagger possesses even fewer.
So happy (late) birthday Mick, and keep kicking much ass!

rollingstones,hq0tz3,Cash_Basis,1,Will the official release of Brussels Affair be available on streaming services like Spotify?,"Does anyone know for a fact if the Brussels Affair will be included on Spotify when the Goats Head Soup rerelease comes out in September? Luckily Leeds '71 was put on Spotify when Sticky Fingers was rereleased in 2015 but the information on their website has me worried.

After looking at the official stones store, it seems that physical copies of Brussels Affair are only available as a part of the CD and vinyl box sets. Both of which are over $100, but I guess that's cheap considering the $750 limited release from several years back. This wasn't the case with the Sticky Fingers rerelease. I was able to buy my dad the CD's with the Leeds shows in 2015 without having to buy a $150 box set.

Given that there is no mention of whether Brussels Affair will be put on Spotify, and the fact that it's only available as a part of expensive box sets on the official store has me a little pissed. 

I don't understand why they make it so difficult to listen to one of their best and cleanest live recordings. Why must it always be part of an expensive box set? Jagger's already loaded, what does he need? A bigger headstone?

I'd gladly pay for the box set if the money went to helping Mick Taylor pay his electric bill.",9,1594583719

rollingstones,hclcp6,spartan1711,1,Get Yer Ya-Yas Out version of Sympathy for the Devil is the best version of the song and contains one of the most under appreciated guitar solos ever,"I‚Äôm not sure why no one talks about Mick Taylor‚Äôs guitar solo on this track but it‚Äôs unbelievable. Keef plays a solo halfway through the song that is good, but nothing noteworthy. A classic grimy stones solo. Then Mick comes in and absolutely lights his axe on fire. For about 2 minutes he shows the stones and Keef that he‚Äôs the lead guitar man. It‚Äôs simply brilliant.

At first I didn‚Äôt like the GYYYsO version because there are no bongos, no ‚Äúwoo-woos‚Äù, and no piano. The original is unbelievable, probably my favorite song of all time, and I didn‚Äôt think you could have the song without those 3 key components. They‚Äôre so distinct and so important to the samba vibe and crescendoing tempo that it wouldn‚Äôt be the same song without them. But the GYYYsO version is the only live version that just has 5 Stones on it. No one else. The guitar interweaving between MT and Keef is some of the best in the entire Stones catalogue. The original studio version only has one guitar throughout (lead). I think this is because Keef was playing the bass on the original?? (The original studio versions bass line is one of the greatest of all time BTW. Listen with headphones that crank up the bass and enjoy the interplay between Nicky Hopkins left hand and Keefs unreal bass play).

Basically the GYYYsO version is bad ass and It deserves more appreciation. As a Stones fan I take MT for granted, but his virtuosity genuinely rivals Clapton, Page, Beck.",28,1592655329

ON THIS DATE (57 YEARS AGO)  
June 7, 1963 ‚Äì The Rolling Stones: ‚ÄúCome On‚Äù b/w ‚ÄúI Want to Be Loved) (Decca F11675) debut 45 single is released in the UK.

""Come On"" is a song written and first released by Chuck Berry in 1961. The Rolling Stones released a version as their debut single in 1963. ""Come On"" was chosen as the Rolling Stones' debut single. Released in the summer of 1963, it reached number 21 on the UK singles charts. The B-side was another cover version, Willie Dixon's ""I Want to Be Loved"". Both songs were recorded in May 1963.

That same night, they made their television debut in England on ITV's ""Thank Your Lucky Stars."" After the show, the producer was reported to have told Stones' manager Andrew Loog Oldham to get rid of ""that vile looking singer with the tire-tread lips.""

Mick Jagger (1972): ""I don't think Come On was very good, in fact, it was s--t. God knows how it ever got in the charts, it was such a hype. In fact, we disliked it so much we didn't do it on any of our gigs.""

rollingstones,gona1x,Ice-Tiger,3,Which other classic bands DO you like?,"Since we had the other thread about classic bands we don't like, let's also have one for ones that we DO like! 

&amp;#x200B;

For me I'm a giant Aerosmith fan, I've seen them live multiple times and even met a few of the band members once (Tom Hamilton, Joey Kramer, and Brad Whitford), all of whom were great guys. I mentioned to Brad that ""People like to say the two greatest guitarists of all time are Hendrix and Jimmy Page, I always say you and Keith Richards!"" he seemed to like that compliment. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also really into Black Sabbath, Cheap Trick, Blue Cheer, David Bowie, Guns N Roses, and The Eagles (who I know got some flack last thread, which I can understand but as for me, I love them). There's a ton of other bands but I don't want fill up too much space here. So what other bands are YOU into?",16,1590167336

They were definitely the coolest concert ive ever been to and eger will (2019) and I've seen many people say they will tour until they literally die. I know some people dont like to think about a world without them, but its just a fact of life that it will come, so i wanted to ask what would happen if we were to lose a member like Keith, Charlie or Ronnie? Would Mick &amp; others call it quits or find a touring replacement? What if it was Mick we lost? Would they quit? Would Keith take over all lead vocals? Or will they actually stop touring soon and just live out the rest of their lives with family?",11,1590024304

But I think it‚Äôs pretty clear that he had an influence on some of the music that the Stones put out and I‚Äôve read rumours that Gram may have had a hand in writing Wild Horses.

Sorry to ramble, but my question is why do you think Mick and Keith seem to downplay any influence Gram might have had on the band when it‚Äôs clear they developed a taste for country around the same time Keith and Gram became friends

imo, ronnie performs the worst on the album, not that he doesn't play well, just that the others pretty much outshine him on every song. hand of fate, crazy mama and fool to cry have some of the most interesting sounding guitar parts the stones ever recorded.

i think mick taylor was influencing the band more and more up until he left, steering them in a different direction than what ronnie would go on to do, which was basically the standard blues rock stuff they did for ages. be really interestimg to think what music they would've produced with a different, more avant-garde guitarist.",16,1584299592

rollingstones,f2uner,JohnJackField,1,Ticket Buying Horror Story,"       In the Wake of the new No Filter leg Ill offer my story of how I bought tickets LAST Year for the Denver Show. DO NOT DO WHAT I DID!

Prologue:

My Son (15) is a life time Stones fan, I am too, I was ecstatic when they announced their US tour for No Filter! Tickets would go on sale in November and me and him would go for his Christmas present. 

November, 10 minutes before PRESALE:

I sat eagerly at my desk at work on the ticket master website waiting for tickets to drop, I had throughly planned everything out, in a separate window my Credit card info awaited so I could copy and paste as needed. 

0 Minutes before Presale.
I imminently Jumped into the queue, 2,000+ people were ahead of me, I thought I‚Äôd have to wait for an eternity 

10 Minutes After Presale. 
I finally got into the ticket buying area, I tried selecting seats, only for a message to read ‚ÄúAnother Fan has Already claimed these seats‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh well‚Äù I said to myself, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs many more‚Äù 

But there weren‚Äôt, every time that message would pop up, at least 5 ones I selected seats only for my hopes to be Crushed. But then I Finally Selected Seats and they were Mine! I thought the Hard part was over, 

Little did I know, it wasn‚Äôt. 

I went to checkout 7 minutes on the clock put in my address, my Name, phone number, yada yada, but when it came, I filled out my Credit card info, only for it to be denied, I looked it over and tried again, DENIED, Then, I noticed, something Odd, the only Payment option was American Express, I don‚Äôt have American Express and it was an Mercian express PRESALE, I FREAKED OUT At this point my stomach sank to my feet, I couldn‚Äôt breathe, my world was gonna crash and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to buy those tickets. I Had a thought, I stood up from my Cubical and yelled out to my fellow co workers 

‚ÄúDoes anyone have American Express‚Äù I Yelled ‚ÄúI Will pay you back‚Äù my friend, (ironically named Keith) said he did, he gave me his card and I quickly put in my info with Less then 30 seconds on the clock, I got the tickets, through myself back and let out an audible sigh, I turned around, at least 10 people were behind me watching, My Victory was their Victory, gotta love my co workers and gotta love the stones!",9,1581528318

While I certainly think there are better live albums and bootlegs from the Stones, I appreciate that the two disc set includes a whole bunch of random songs that they either hadn't included on a live album or hadn't in 30+ years.  

Sure disc 1 has all the usual hits; but disc 2 is shockingly deep with cuts like Neighbors, You Don't Have to Mean it, Monkey Man, and a number of covers.

Opening this to a broader conversation, what are some of your favorite non-hits or covers included on a live album?  I think my all time favorite is ""I Can't Turn You Loose"" off of *Sticky Fingers: Live at the Fonda.*",0,1580311594

rollingstones,eurr8t,jaygerland,1,Starting to sound like we'll get a US tour that could be announced as soon as next week...,"My wife keeps close tabs on several FB groups and websites that deal in tour rumors. Sounds like it's all but done and we'll get an announcement maybe by the end of next week. Buffalo (where I am) and several other markets that were not visited last year. Apparently the new stage they rolled out last year (maybe in 2018) was built for a few years of touring and this was always the plan.

This is also being tied to the NFL markets like they did last year. During the Grammy's last night, there were two Pepsi commercials teasing a bigger commercial during the Super Bowl that featured the Stones' ""Paint It Black"" with Missy Eliot. Seems like another clue. Maybe we'll even learn something this weekend.

Again, I don't know what my wife is looking at, I'm not on FB, but these are things I've picked up from her, I'm not here to argue one way or another but shit yeah I'm looking for more RS shows this summer!

Dammit, they absolutely killed it last year: so sharp, so crisp, so beautifully on the fucking money. Power, precision, energy in spades.

I compared it to some shows from 2017-18 and I was stunned by the difference. In 2017-18 tempos dragged, Keith was blowing cues, and Mick sounded increasingly fatigued. They finally really sound like just very old men trying to plag rock and roll. 2019 somehow was faster, tighter and all around excellent. Mick's voice is in fantastic shape, Keith and Ronnie both play beautifully, and Charlie is just un-fucking-stoppable at 78. That they pull off those accelerated endings to YCAGWY and Midnight Rambler is incredible to me.

Everywhere I search for the lyrics to this song, those two words are spelled ""miss"", but if you listen to the original studio version of this song, it doesn't sound like ""miss"" at all.  


 In fact, the first ""miss"" sounds like ""pick"" or ""keep"" or something like that, and the second one sounds more like ""kiss"".

rollingstones,e7bhe7,Illustrious_Spirit91,1,What Exactly Happened at Altamont," Just to explain myself a bit with this one, I do this thing on Tumblr where I retell some of the crazy stories I've heard in regards to Rock and Roll with varying degrees of sarcasm. I'm not claiming to be the best researched around here, but I do try to provide where I'm reading this stuff, as well as other places which may provide better info on the subject than I ever could. Constructive criticism is very much welcomed with this. With that out of the way, this is the little piece I did on the Altamont Free Concert of 1969:

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img b8d6o036t5341...*

Let‚Äôs face it, 1969 was a pretty crazy year no matter where you stand. On one hand, there were the moon landings, Woodstock, and general protesting against the Vietnam War (much to the chagrin of the Establishment), but on the other hand, there was the Chappaquiddick incident, the death of Brian Jones, and the Beatles starting to head full-steam down the path that led to their breakup in April 1970.¬†

And then, there was Altamont, what has otherwise been labeled as the darkest day in Rock and Roll History.¬† 

This one‚Äôs going to be frustrating (and as an aside, I‚Äôm actually quite glad that Brian Jones missed out on this one, and likely would have even if he hadn‚Äôt drowned, because of his getting fired from the Rolling Stones in June 1969).

Let me start off by positing one simple question: Which *dumbass* came up with the bright idea of hiring the Hell's Angels as security?!

Okay, I guess I‚Äôd better start earlier than that, even, with some of the lead-in. The Rolling Stones had last performed in the concert circuit in 1967, and by June 1969, they wanted to get back on the road. One problem: their guitarist, Brian Jones, was unable to get a work visa due to having racked up two drug convictions in the meantime (at least one of which was probably based on planted evidence). Even then, Brian, for reasons known mostly to him and only speculated upon by me, had stopped contributing to the Stones‚Äô music, if he even showed up to recording sessions at all. Mick Jagger, himself, said that Brian‚Äôs last major contribution to a Rolling Stones song was the hauntingly beautiful slide guitar on the melancholic¬†‚ÄúNo Expectations‚Äù.¬†

*Processing img vg3hk18ft5341...*

It was their road manager, Ian Stewart, who brought up the idea of letting Brain go from the band. Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts had absolutely no say in the decision, but ultimately, on June 8, 1969, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards went to Brian‚Äôs residence, Cotchford Farm, to tell him he was being fired, with Charlie tagging along to make sure a fight didn‚Äôt break out. However, by most accounts, Brian had been expecting this would happen, and agreed to leave the band without raising a fuss. Mick and Keith left the press statement up to Brian, and possibly to save face, he decided to make it look like he‚Äôd left the band on his own accord.¬†

The statement read:¬†‚ÄúI no longer see eye to eye with the others over the discs we are cutting. We no longer communicate musically. The Stones‚Äô music is not to my taste any more. The work of Mick and Keith has progressed at a tangent, at least to my way of thinking. I have a desire to play my own brand of music rather than that of others, no matter how much I appreciate their musical concepts. We had a friendly meeting and agreed that an amicable termination, temporary or permanent, was the only answer. The only solution was to go our separate ways, but we shall still remain friends. I love those fellows.‚Äù 

How much of this statement was true is up to personal conjecture. In either case, Brian was replaced by 20-year-old Mick Taylor, who‚Äôd previously played with John Mayall‚Äôs Bluesbreakers. In a press conference on June 13, the band announced Taylor‚Äôs arrival, as well a free concert in Hyde Park on July 5 to introduce the youngest member of the band.¬†

Then, just two days before the concert, Brian drowned in his backyard swimming pool at the age of twenty-seven. His death was ruled as misadventure (which personal research seems to back up), but theories persist to this day that he was, instead, murdered.¬†

In the blink of an eye, the Hyde Park gig went from being an introduction to Mick Taylor to being a tribute to Brian Jones. In honor of Brian, the concert began with Mick reading two verses from Percy Bysshe Shelley‚Äôs¬†‚ÄúAdonais,‚Äù and as the band began playing¬†‚ÄúI‚Äôm Yours and I‚Äôm Hers‚Äù (one of Brian‚Äôs favorite songs), 2,500 cabbage white butterflies were released (against stipulation), though, by this point, many had died in the July heat, due to the boxes not being properly ventilated. Even if, on a technical level, it wasn‚Äôt one of the Stones‚Äô best shows, it still showed the world at large that the Stones were back (baby).¬†

So, what does all this have to do with Altamont? Well, providing security that day was the London chapter of the Hell‚Äôs Angels. Apparently, that one started with Rock Scully, after he‚Äôd hired the Angels as security on multiple occasions while managing the Grateful Dead.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing gif lp5ed2kvt5341...*

Thing is, the London chapter was a lot calmer when compared with the Oakland branch of the infamous Hell's Angels

So yeah, there‚Äôs problem #2‚Ä¶

That summer, a little concert called Woodstock took place, which ended up epitomizing the peace and love movement. But if that was the high, then Altamont was what brought that idealism to a screeching halt (one of many things, actually).¬†

Problem #3: the concert was based entirely on the notion that the Stones could hold a free concert as a sort of West Coast Woodstock.¬†

After all, even journalists throughout that tour had been complaining about high ticket prices (even though $3-$8 seems to me a steal considering they were going for a minimum of $159 by the time they got to Seattle in 2019). What could go wrong?

Those of you familiar with Murphy‚Äôs Law may be able to see where I‚Äôm going with all this.¬†

Problem #4: their tour manager, Sam Cutler, just couldn‚Äôt get a venue.¬†

He tried to score them a gig in San Francisco, but there was a football game taking place, San Jose wouldn‚Äôt have another concert so soon after the last one (and they were kind of done with the whole hippie thing anyway), and Sears Point Raceway asked for a $100,000 fee as well as distribution rights to the concert footage (the entire tour had been filmed by a crew including the Maysles brothers and future Star Wars director George Lucas). So, a mere forty-eight hours before the concert began, the Stones finally settled on Altamont Speedway.¬†

Needless to say, anyone who‚Äôs ever been to a concert or organized any large scale events would be able to tell you that choosing the venue at the last minute is *never* a good idea. This is also evidenced by the fact that the venue was covered in trash and lacked basic amenities such as water and toilets, but hey, the owner offered it for free, so why not?

I swear, the level of incompetence shown by multiple parties throughout these proceedings is on another level (and I read the Darwin Awards‚Ä¶)

Also, as a result of the *astronomically* poor planning, the stage was only an inch off the ground, and since there were only two days before the concert, there was no time to make the stage safe, so already, anyone playing at Altamont the day of December 6 were putting themselves at risk (I don‚Äôt know if waivers were signed either). Not to mention the fact that there would be absolutely no barriers between the performers and the reported 300,000 attendees.¬†

So, that should cover problems #6 and #7, but in my personal opinion, the coup de grace of all these fuck-ups was the decision to hire the Oakland chapter of the Hell‚Äôs Angels as security.¬†

Again, as I said, the Stones¬†*did* have the London Hell‚Äôs Angels at the Stones in the Park concert and the Sacramento Hell's Angels had done security at Grateful Dead shows in the past without incident, but anyone who knows anything worth a damn about the Oakland Hell‚Äôs Angels would know that it‚Äôs a whole different ballpark dealing with them. From what I‚Äôve heard, the hippies had an unrealistically idealized version of them in their heads (due to the whole outcast from society thing), and Cutler apparently even tried warning the Stones about the¬†‚Äúreal‚Äù Hell‚Äôs Angels. Even then, the Hell‚Äôs Angels were offered $500 worth of beer to basically just sit on the side of the stage and make sure no one got too close.¬†

If you‚Äôll excuse me, I need to go call the organizers fucking idiots in a minimum of seven languages. ‚Ä¶ Okay, I‚Äôm good. Still pissed, but I‚Äôm fine.¬†

In either case, also not helping matters was that at least 95% of the audience were high on one substance or another, because, let‚Äôs face it, this was the hippie movement. And according to Rolling Stone magazine, the organizers also didn‚Äôt warn neighboring landowners of the hippies descending on the scene, set the whole thing in a desolate, treeless, wasteland (and still there was no clear barrier between the performers and the audience), the sound system was shit, and in general, the stage was completely surrounded by people and their cars (many of said cars wound up serving as makeshift latrines).¬†

I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôm already smelling a disaster waiting to happen.¬†

The concert was to feature Santana, Jefferson Airplane, The Flying Burrito Brothers, Crosby, Stills, Nash, &amp; Young, The Grateful Dead, and of course, the Rolling Stones.¬†

Things started out smoothly with Santana‚Äôs set, but only deteriorated from there, as the Hell‚Äôs Angels got increasingly drunk. Throughout the day, the Angels would attack anyone who was being problematic (sometimes with sawed-off pool cues and motorcycle chains), although their victims include a guy running around naked and another who was trying to take pictures of the stage. So basically, they were just attacking anyone they didn't like. Things only got worse after someone (maybe accidentally) knocked over one of the Angels‚Äô motorcycles. During Jefferson Airplane‚Äôs set, Marty Balin jumped into the crowd to stop a fight and was knocked unconscious, and when Paul Kantner sarcastically thanked the Angels, one, Bill Fritsch, took up a microphone and argued with him about it. One woman called a radio show the next day to say that she saw several fistfights break out, and every single one of them involved the Hell‚Äôs Angels. When she tried to speak up about it, other people around her told her to keep quiet out of fear of provoking them. Denise Jewkes, lead singer of Ace of Cups and who was *six months pregnant*, got hit in the head by a beer bottle, causing a skull fracture (the Stones later paid for her medical expenses). Stephen Stills was reportedly stabbed in the leg several times by a ‚Äústoned-out‚Äù Hell‚Äôs Angel. When the Rolling Stones flew in, Mick was punched in the face almost the second he got off the helicopter. Things got so bad, that the Grateful Dead basically just said¬†‚ÄúFuck it‚Äù and got the hell out of dodge.¬†

Apparently, the only time the crowds calmed down, even a little, was when the Flying Burrito Brothers took the stage.¬†

It was dark when the Rolling Stones finally took the stage (partly because Bill Wyman missed the first helicopter, partly because Mick Jagger loves dramatic effect that way), and by then, things were only deteriorating further (if such a thing is even possible). Fighting between audience member and Hell‚Äôs Angel alike kept breaking out, to the point where Mick stopped the show in a vain attempt to get the crowd to calm down.¬†

All I can say is,¬†‚ÄúToo little, too late.‚Äù

*Processing img 7alnobs2u5341...*

 And still, as the Stones tried to keep performing, the situation only got worse. While Mick was singing¬†‚ÄúUnder My Thumb‚Äù, yet another melee broke out, and in the chaos, 18-year-old Meredith Hunter, who had come with his girlfriend Patti Bredehoft and who happened to be high on meth at this very moment, was stabbed to death by 21-year-old Alan Passaro, after apparently brandishing a .22 caliber revolver in the direction of the stage. Passaro was later acquitted of all charges, which I think was a horrible mistake. It‚Äôs impossible to know for certain whether Hunter had been trying to defend himself or if he actually intended to shoot Mick Jagger, but what is known is that Hunter‚Äôs murder was captured on camera. You can watch the footage, but I must say, it makes for grisly viewing. 

I think it's also important to note that the Hell's Angels had also been roughing up Meredith prior to this, and were apparently giving him a hard time due to the fact that he was dating a white woman (because, you know, racism). That, and one witness said that he appeared upset at the violence, but not crazily enraged (though like with anything involving witness reports, that is a matter of debate). 

People who were at the scene have since reported that Hunter was in urgent need of medical attention. However, the helicopter pilots who were there refused to take off for anyone but the Rolling Stones. Even though this was *clearly* a life or death situation. 

Excuse me, I need to take another break to scream to the heavens about why this was allowed‚Ä¶.

Needless to say, Hunter died while waiting for an ambulance to come. In addition, two other people were killed in a hit-and-run accident, whilst another drowned in an irrigation canal under the influence of LSD. Also, four babies were born (one of those birth announcements can be observed in the film *Gimme Shelter).*¬†

The next day, the Stones were on a plane back to London.¬†

In the years since Hunter‚Äôs death, *no one* in the Rolling Stones, the Grateful Dead, or the Hell‚Äôs Angels have taken responsibility for what happened. The Hell‚Äôs Angels, the organizers, and the crowds blamed each other for what happened, and the Stones have never really spoken up about it. They‚Äôve never even had the decency of apologizing to Meredith Hunter‚Äôs family.¬†

If you ask me though, I‚Äôd say that the fault lies entirely with *everyone* who organized this whole mess. *Somehow*, everyone involved was naive and/or stupid enough to try and organize an entire concert in just a few weeks as opposed to months, and the decision to hire the Hell‚Äôs Angels as security and pay them with alcohol only exacerbated the ineptitude of everyone involved.¬†

Let‚Äôs face it, none of the organizers were innocent, and no one in the crowd escaped without losing their collective innocence. There‚Äôs a damn good reason that this is considered the death knell for the 60's peace and love movement, and it‚Äôs all in the footage taken that night.¬†

rollingstones,e5qhb4,RockNSoulBrother,1,Unpopular Opinion: Dirty Work isn‚Äôt horrible,"I‚Äôve always been a Rolling Stones fan and I‚Äôve listened to Exile on Main Street, Let It Bleed, Beggars Banquet and all of their other early masterpieces countless times. Currently, I‚Äôm taking up the goal of collecting every one of the Stones‚Äô albums on vinyl. Just recently though, I ventured beyond Some Girls and Tattoo You. I was already familiar with songs like ‚ÄúUndercover (Of The Night)‚Äù and ‚ÄúMixed Emotions‚Äù, but I never really knew the entirety of Undercover, Dirty Work, Steel Wheels, etc. I‚Äôve finally finished completely their discography from the 80s up and am very happy. It really reinforced my love for one of my favorite bands, although of course these albums weren‚Äôt as strong as their earlier works.

Before listening to these albums, I always knew that people generally disliked Dirty Work. And I completely understand why. Jagger and Richards had never been farther apart as songwriters, Richards drug abuse was continuing to spiral out of control, and they were trying to stay relevant by including cliche 80s trends into their music which ultimately destroyed the heart and soul of their music. After all that though, I didn‚Äôt think the album was half bad upon listening to it. It honestly captured my attention a lot better than Undercover ever did. I loved ‚ÄúOne Hit (To The Body‚Äù, ‚ÄúHarlem Shuffle‚Äù, ‚ÄúToo Rude‚Äù, ‚ÄúWinning Ugly‚Äù (I absolutely love this song), and ‚ÄúSleep Tonight.‚Äù All of the other songs felt a little more like filler, but it wasn‚Äôt bad filler at all.

The album cover and title really does make me cringe tho haha. And songs like ‚ÄúBack To Zero‚Äù are definitely not Stones songs. But I think people don‚Äôt give the album a chance. It‚Äôs not an amazing album, or even close to one, but I don‚Äôt think The Rolling Stones have ever, ever released a bad album.",6,1575418431

rollingstones,dzqeo6,PeterGreen27,1,A point about If You Really Want To Be My Friend and It's Only Rock'n'Roll in general,"this song is one of the most underrated stones tracks to me, and one of their best ballads. should be right up there with shine a light, cant always get what you want and angie, but for some reason, its not rated that highly. its got a pretty good rhythm, great lyrics and of course, a great guitar solo. what more could you want?

the whole album is pretty underrated i feel, or at least not thought of as highly as it should be. i know this is sacriligeous, but i think Only Rock'n'Roll is honestly better than beggars banquet. there, i said it. or if you dont think it is, its definitely on par with some girls. i think they've both got that same playful, fun time rock'n'roll spirit (whereas BB is a pretty dour affair) and should be rated as equals.

rollingstones,dyz66r,PeterGreen27,1,Do you prefer Sticky Fingers or Exile on Main St.?,"If you look at any Best Albums list for the Stones, Nr.1 will usually be occupied by one of these. And while I feel generally Exile is rated higher than Sticky, I think they're both equally the best stuff they've put out (album-wise). I like Exile, and it has some really good songs like Tumbling Dice, Sweet Virgina, Let It Loose and of course, Shine A Light. On the whole though, Exile is too loose and inconsistent for me. Sort of has the same issues as the White Album.

To me, Sticky Fingers is just a way tighter collection of good songs. Brown Sugar, Bitch, Sway, Can't You Hear Me Knockin', Wild Horses and Dead Flowers are all undeniable Stones canon. I Got The Blues, Sister Morphine and Moonlight Mile are also popular, but i think to a lesser extent. 

So what do you think? I know it's kind of an old hat, but every debate about a band that's existed for 60 years is, by this point, an old hat, so who cares.",36,1574238438

I thought the girl died on Halloween, not in an alleyway. 


A ten year old girl on a street corner 
Sticking needles in her arm 
She died in the dirt of an alleyway 
Her mother said she had no chance, no chance!

The worst of all time though was Rocks Off.  I thought the line was ‚Äú...the sunshine boys...(garbled garbled) the daylights out of me.‚Äù And that the sunshine boys was a reference to Mick and Keef. 


Feel so hypnotized, can't describe the scene
It's all mesmerized, all that inside me
The sunshine bores the daylights out of me
Chasing shadows, moonlight mystery

Now, to be fair, I‚Äôve been listening to the Stones back in the 70‚Äôs when there was no access to lyrics. 

But still. Am I the only one to mishear Stones lyrics?",10,1572891725

I think the only song they've played since the tour ended was ""Streets of Love"" in 2014. If they can keep ""You Got Me Rocking"" and ""Out of Control"" in rotation, as well as pull out something like ""Sad, Sad, Sad,"" ""Neighbors,"" or ""The Worst"" every once in awhile, I don't see why ""Streets,"" ""Rain Fall Down,"" ""Rough Justice,"" ""Infamy,"" ""This Place is Empty,"" and ""Oh No Not You Again"" can be done every so often.",4,1572886598

I started listening to the Rolling Stones albums in chronological order (both U.S. and U.K. versions) on Spotify. I really like the U.S. version of Out of Our Heads and I thought it would be worth it to buy it on vinyl. But why can't I find a brand new vinyl copy of it on Amazon or Amoeba? All I can find there are the original 1965 pressings (which are expensive and too much for my budget) and the U.K. version which I prefer less. So what I'm really asking is... why didn't they press the U.S. version of Out of Our Heads beyond 1965? I'd really love to own it on vinyl. Did they really only make Out of Our Heads (U.S. version) in 1965 only?,2,1572786331

rollingstones,do16uv,maerob99,16,What Makes the Stones Loved Across so Many Generations?,,12,1572220567
rollingstones,dnxyeq,August_West_1990,4,Best and Worst Tours?,"With over 50 years of performances under their belt, the Stones have obviously established themselves as one of the greatest live acts of all time. Also, given their age, various periods of substance abuse, varying quality of material, etc., they've obviously had their ups and downs over the years. For those who've either seen or listened to the thousands of hours of live albums, bootlegs, videos, etc., what would you say are their Top 5 best and worst tours? For me, it's as follows:

**Best:**

1. U.S Tour 1969 (the peak of the band at their most dangerous, leanest and meanest. Armed to the teeth with some of the best material of their whole career. Ferocious energy.)
2. U.S. Tour 1972 ( a bit more reckless and raw than 1969, yet still maintaining an almost inexplicable sense of cohesion and sophistication in their playing. Plus, any show almost entirely compromised of songs from the big four is inherently excellent.)
3. European Tour 1973 (similar to 1972, tighter in some ways and even looser in others. Taylor at his peak. Also, I'm of the opinion that the Brussels shows are their best ever.)
4. Licks Tour 2002-03 (the pinnacle of the band as rock's elder statesmen. They maintained an extremely high standard from beginning to end, and with no new material to tour behind the set was freed up for them to bust out a slew of songs one thought would never be played live (and some that have never been played since.) Also, this was the first tour I saw them live (the MSG HBO special).
5. Voodoo Lounge (The start of the peak of the band's latter period. the album may have been inconsistent, but the unique structure of these shows (doing theaters and smaller venues, acoustic sets, the amount of deep cuts they dug out here, and the overall quality of the playing) puts it up there for me.

**Worst**:

1. Europe 14 on Fire (the one tour where I can't sit through a single full concert. Uninspired playing and song choices (including the bizarre choice  on Keith's part to bring back ""Can't Be Seen,"" which he mangled every time). I do enjoy the Japan shows right before, though.
2. Tour of Europe '76 (between the dry, lifeless soundboards that circulate, sloppy playing from both Ronnie and Keith, Mick snarling and barking instead of singing, and the fact that almost all of the *Black and Blue* songs sounded awful live, this stands out as especially weak for me.)
3. Europe '07 (The *Bigger Bang* tour maintained strength well into 2006, but after Keith's accident they should've taken some time off. These shows sound largely tired and border on train wrecks at times.)
4. Winter '73 (sandwiched two of their best tours, this one just sounded tired and sloppy based on the shows I've heard. The reviews I've read from people who attended (and even Bill Wyman) don't have fond memories of it, either.)
5. Tattoo You (I don't not enjoy this tour, as there may highlights (""Just My Imagination,"" ""Time is on My Side,"" ""Under My Thumb,"" the return of ""Satisfaction"" as a regular), but this the pinnacle of Mick's atonal barking as opposed to singing, and the whole band somehow managed to sound both sloppy yet slick and polished to an almost soulless degree. I don't think the *Tattoo You* material sounded good live, and the run of warhorses at the end of the set are the worst incarnations I've heard of them (except maybe ""Start Me Up,"" which was played with a groove close to the record before they sped it up in later years).

These are just my thoughts, I'd be curious to see more seasoned fans' opinions.",16,1572203065

rollingstones,dh9ej3,MAronM,12,"Lyrical, musical and vocal peaks in Stones catalogue?","I think the lyrics peak at Let It Bleed.
Mick was never as playful with lyrics as he was on Let It Bleed, the title track, Monkey Man and even YCAGWYW have really interesting lines I really, really like. 

Vocally I think Mick peaked at Goats Head Soup and Exile. He sings higher and seems a tiny bit more experimental. Maybe years of singing started to affect him at this point and forced him to sorta stray off from his usual style? All I know is that he sings a tiny bit higher and his tone is a bit different, I noticed it better on Goats Head Soup but it's really clear on Exile too. Not at all on Sticky Fingers...

Musical peak is a bit harder for me because my favourite album changes every month but it must be Exile too, just because of all the variety in genres and so on. 

Favourite guitar work I suppose is on Sticky Fingers but nothing beats the weaving in Some Girls.",11,1570966154

rollingstones,dbwch4,Kuttlan,10,Do you think there will be a Rolling Stones biopic and if so who should play them?,,23,1569949347
rollingstones,dbmbva,August_West_1990,9,What Songs Do You Want To See Come Back Before They Call it Quits?,"We‚Äôve seen a couple of songs come back in the last five years (Mercy Mercy, Play with Fire, Under My Thumb, She‚Äôs a Rainbow, Harlem Shuffle, Fool to Cry, Emotional Rescue, Silver Train, Little T&amp;A, Mixed Emotions) either semi-regularly or once or twice. 

With the band admittedly closer to the end than the beginning, which songs do you still want to see return at least once before it‚Äôs all over? Keep in mind I‚Äôm thinking of songs that have not been done in a decade or more, with some exceptions. My personal faves:

- Little Queenie (last some in 1998)
- Mother‚Äôs Little Helper (was it ever done live?
This is the one key hit from the 1965-67 period I‚Äôm surprised they never dig out. Would sound great pared with Paint It Black)
- Time is On My Side (last some in 1998, and even that was the only one since 1982. Would be the perfect opener if we get a 60th anniversary tour)
- 100 Years Ago (beautiful deep cut that I just want to hear once)
- Salt of the Earth (last done in 2003)
- Star, Star (last done in 2003, as long as Mick doesn‚Äôt awkwardly try and modernize the Ally McGraw verse)
- 19th Nervous Breakdown (last done in 2005, although even then they couldn‚Äôt pull off the tempo at all)

Some that were done fairly frequently in the last 10-15 years that disappeared fairly recently are Whip, Live with Me, CYHMK, Little T&amp;A, and Just My Imagination. Also stuff that was a regular on one tour then got dropped (Emotional Rescue, Don‚Äôt Stop).",19,1569895458

Just that sentence is very similar to Beast Of Burden's
""I'll never be your beast of burden""

I could see Mick thinking Beast of Burden is a better alternative to word ""slave""

Otherwise the songs are not very similar, but clearly Mick and Keith weren't perfectly happy with Slave in 75 as it got shelved.

rollingstones,d55ylr,RoastBeefDisease,4,Are the different versions of Some Girls?,"Sorry if its a dumb question, im not the biggest stones fan and definitely dont know everything about them, but ive been on a huge Stones listening binge since seeing them a month ago. Ive known their music since i was a little kid but it was mainly their early stuff. I wouldnt say i became a ""fan"" until 2018 though when i was 17.

Ive been trying to increase my stones record collection since i only owned HONK and Flowers compilations. Over the weekend i found a atore with a pretty decent sized collection, and 2 versions of Some Girls. One was the original i was familiar with that goes Green, Yellow, Blue, Pink from top to bottom, but the 2nd one had a different color. I looked and it was all the same tracklist but i think the top was white? I dont remember exactly, i just know it was a different color/colors. It was also more expensive.",4,1568664921

For me, it always robs a spot on the set list that could be saved for something more interesting. For me, it just goes on forever without ever varying, really.

My point is when they were at their peak, they release classics like ‚ÄúLet it Bleed‚Äù or ‚ÄúExile on Main St.‚Äù and they only sell a few million.  To put that in perspective, ‚Äúsgt peppers‚Äù by the Beatles sold 31 million, ‚Äúnevermind‚Äù by nirvana sold about 27 million.

The bulk of their sales is also mainly in America. 

I assume they got decent radio play back in the day, today they are played all the time, and in movies and on tv, their tours are among the highest grossing of all time,  they are one of the most famous bands of all time.
